Scenery and the hikes are well worth it! Hike to Delicate Arch was about 1 1/2 hours uphill. Take lots of rest breaks and dont give up, umntil you reach the arch, as the view is wonderful",

We were led thru the three hour hike by a guide who explained to us the history of the park, its founder, plans s of the region, rock formations etched... If you can schedule this tour at $!16 a person it is so worth it. Mornings meg tours are booked on line months in advance. The afternoon yours are first come first served.

Big horn sheep are prevalent and will not hesitate to approach your parked vehicle. We arrived in the early afternoon and drove to most all of the lookouts, then caught a beautiful sunset. We came back that evening after it was completely dark to view the stars. It is absolutely incredible, and quite scary to be in pure darkness and silence and view thousands upon thousands of stars. The following day we returned and hiked the saddle pass, castle, and medicine root trail which was about 4 miles over all. To get the best experience at the badlands, catch a sunrise or sunset, and wear boots that you are able to get a little off course with.

Stop and Newspaper Rock, very cool pictographs, right of the parking area, it's a must seeand it's before you get into the park, so it's free!!!! The Needles area has some some cool Arches, the 'Wooden Shoe\"Rock, The Grand view, etc . But Find Elephant Hill Trail! It's near the campground (of the same name)it's a rural road, about 10 miles long, it's a crazy, fun trail, with some very different Rock formations ! I think it was my favorite part of Needles ! We did not go to The Maze , as it was recommended for Off-road vehicle only and after Elephant Trail, we got all the 4 wheeling we felt the truck could go! ",

There were plenty of other hikes to choose from if we had more time. This park is best for able-bodied people, as there aren't as many overlooks or paved paths compared to other National Parks.

We went anyway. Our first stop on the 30 mile plus loop of the lake was a winter wonderland of snow and ice. Actually a bit fun for us since we rarely see \"weather\".

And then at the next stop the clouds began to open little by little and oh my. The lake is marvelous to behold and I am certain would be stunning on a clear calm day.

We took the windy road up to the Pinnacle Overlook and the views were amazing. We also stopped at Ft McCook overlook as well. On the way down we parked in Thomas Walker parking area and hiked to the Historic Cumberland Gap Pass. We decided to do the Tri-State Peak as well. That is a way more challenging hike especially right at the end as it's almost all up hill. Once at the top you can say you are standing in TN, KY and Virginia and have the signs to prove it. It was worth the hike to say we did it. Unfortunately the cave tour wasn't running yet so we'll have to stop back again!",

There are a few cute stores and farm markets. Our favorite is the Boston store just north of Peninsula. The scenery is beautiful. And the people you meet along the way are the friendliest you will meet. You can run, bike or walk. The tow path itself is flat and smooth but there are many hiking trails off of it. The tow path runs along the old Erie canal that you learned about in history. The \"tow\" path is where the mules pulled the boats. Some of the old locks are still there and you can see the old canal for most of the path. There is a train that runs for part of it. You can also put your bike on the train for $2.",

        "text": "We have travelled through Kentucky and camped all over the state, this was our first time in the Daniel Boone National Forrest. First, I want to be clear this is not a review of the forest. The forest stretches from Tennessee to West Virginia and we were in the north central part. Secondly, when we visited here the campgrounds were flooded. There are several hundred campsites but when we arrived there were just four sites which were dry. We took the highest site and were the only campers in the campground for the next seven days. There were no showers in our loop but it did have flush toilets which were kept clean for the two people using them. The rest of the campground was underwater with unsightly flotsam circling the shoreline. The woods were off limits due to the snakes but we had plenty of hiking using the camp park roads. The views were beautiful and once dried out this will be a special spot to explore. There is a beach and camp store both underwater during our stay. This campground is about 15 miles from the closest town, Salt Lick and there is not much in Salt Lick. No fresh foods or reasonably priced supplies. Forget the Dollar store which should be named \"Many Dollars.\" Diesel Fuel at the local BP will cost you $5.00 a gallon! Come to this campground prepared. Firewood is available and delivered to the campsite. Tiny cabins are for rent at $70 buck a night, no water or toilet, it is bare bones. The campsites are private. well spaced and ours was shaded. The site had electricity, a fire pit and gravel padding. We had no trouble maneuvering our 32' Airstream into the spot. During the week we made several day trips. The 15 miles out of the forest takes about thirty-five minutes to drive with no traffic and then you are still another thirty minutes to the Interstate. Google maps gave us fun back roads to explore and we used them instead of the highways but if you are driving a big rig stay on the highways. My Excursion was almost too big for some of the roads. Our day trips were to Natural Bridge State Park, Carter Cave, Moorehead, Mt. Sterling and The Red River Gorge area. There are great places to eat if you avoid the chains, many small cafes and BBQ joints. I do recommend this area as a fun place to explore, Zilpo may not be the best campground to use as a home base, it is better suited for staying at the campsite.",

If you get there before 9 am, they will let you drive your car up to the quarry; if not, you just park at the visitor center and take a free tram to the quarry. The quarry is a building that was built around a mountainside, containing lots of dinosaur bones. They are still digging them out, so you may see rangers working while you're there. Aside from the quarry, there is also a driving portion that you can do. They sell a guidebook for $1 in the visitor center that explains what you see at each stop. However, the road is marked with numbered signs so you'll know where to stop even if you don't have the guidebook. I really found it to be worth the price, though. Depending on how much time you have to spend, you can choose which spots you want to stop at. I stopped at the petroglyph sites and the cabin at the end and found those to be worth it, even if you are short on time. This is worth visiting!",

Check out the innovation in the Fort - cannonball firehouse was interesting.

We didn't know that so couldn't get on. Ferry trip is long and relatively expensive ($175). We took the seaplane. Cost more ($330) but we got there quickly, the flight was a highlight of our vacation, and we got to Dry Tortugas before the ferry so we got to explore before the crowds arrived.

The snorkeling is OK, if you want good snorkeling then you have to swim out about 70 yards to the reef. That's a pretty far swim that most people and familys probably won't be taking. I know that because I saw zero people go out that far while we were there. And with most rental equipment, the snorkel gear they give you doesn't work that well.

I've never had much of a desire to go to KW, but my friends and I planned a 4th of July trip down there & make Dry Tortugas the highlight of the trip. It's a little pricey if you really don't have an idea of what you are getting into (I promise you will NOT regret spending the $$$ once you have been) but it's SO worth it. I say book the Yankee Freedom ferry-they provide you lunch and all gear you need once you get to the island. If you are into History, the fort itself is super cool. The beaches & water a picture perfect & the snorkeling is a blast. If I ever go back to KW again, I would without a doubt do this trip again. Be prepared to spend the entire day on this outing as the boat ride itself is 5 hours round trip. Take some cards or a book to read on the way out there-I napped since we had to get up before the sun to make it. On the way back, they serve drinks on the boat & I think it's best to take the drinks outside on the deck and enjoy the view (albeit it's just water) but you can sometimes see lots of cool marine life around you (turtles, dolphins, etc).

Although the price of the admission almost turned me away....what the day trip offered was an incredible value! The entire experience was awesome! The staff aboard the boat...the snorkeling...breakfast and lunch provided... All 5 stars! I have to mention that the crew of the Yankee Freedom are absolutely the most professional caring people. I witnessed them go above and beyond their job titles to make sure each person on the boat was comfortable and had all they needed to have a safe wonderful experience throughout the entire trip. On arrival to the Dry Tortugas you can tour the fort, swim in the crystal blue ocean, snorkel or do it all. Also if prearranged you can camp at the Dry Tortugas.... That's my next trip plan :) Please don't miss this adventure at Key West. If you had to pick only one paid event while at Key West this would be the one to win. The memories we made on this adventure with be ones I will always treasure. It was mine and my friends first time snorkeling...and with the expert instructions from the crew member.... We were snokeling within 5 minutes like pro's and saw many beautiful fish and a live sand dollar. Just a great day!",

The crew is friendly and helpful. They serve a basic breakfast and lunch (don't expect gourmet) that fills you up. Snorkeling rental is included as well as tours of Fort Jefferson, which is both interesting and beautiful. Wonderful snorkeling in pristine water around the third largest coral reef in the world. The trip takes 2.5 hours by boat. We had smooth water but don't chance it! Take Dramamine for sea sickness a half hour before leaving in the morning. They don't allow plastic water bottles on the island so bring your own insulated reusable water bottle. Camping is available. Lots to photograph. Birders will love the island too. Fantastic day for history and nature lovers. ",

Our guide was very informative and answered any question we had. Once we got to the island we walked the moat then geared up to snorkel. Lots to see in the beautiful carribean waters. We saw hundreds of corals and so many schools of fish. We came after a big stom so we were swarmed by jelly fish and got stung. Kinda scary but we managed. They had vinegar at the snorkel set up and after a few sprays and eating lunch (which was provided) we were back in the water. The only negative thing I would say is there's not enough time. The 4 hours flew by. I will be back to the keys in September and I'm going back to the Tortugas ",

Once at flamingo, we are at the restaurant, which was surprisingly good. Alligator nuggets were delicious. Bring your own water bottles if you have them because they charge $2.50 for a bottle of water. We saw manatees in the marina by chance. When asked, our waitress suggested we make it to Mahogany trail to try to find the nesting owl before sunset. This was on our way back to the homestead entrance. It was amazing at sunset.

I would recommend this site to anyone who is looking for a fun, historic and budget-friendly good time and is interested in Florida's Spanish origins. ",

At 10 a.m. each day they raise the flag, which we didn't know ahead of time and participated in the tradition. It was amazing! The ranger gave the history surrounding why they use a 15 start and stripped flag along with the song they played which is not the Star Spangled Banner.

On arrival, we were met by a friendly Park employee who gave us a briefing on the site and what we needed to be aware of. Most particularly, there are bears and snakes in those woods, so be careful. Anyway, you are given a small map, which guides you through a trail set out in the woods and which winds upwards some 150 feet in elevation. It's not a tough climb, but stopping every once in a while and sipping from your water bottle - a good thing to bring with you - makes it a bit easier. Anyway, pretty soon you arrive at the caves where early inhabitants lived and you are greeted - if you are lucky to hit the right time - by anotyher Park employee who informs you about the dwellings, who lived there, how they survived, etc. It is truly amazing anyone lived in these caves, but given the alternatives, one can understand why they did. The area is beautiful, with several lovely opportunities for pictures. There are a couple of cave drawings as well - somewhat small and inconspicuous - but they are there. The climb down is equally enjoyable and winds you back to your starting point. Total time up and back about a two and a half hours. You could linger a bit more if you wanted to. There are also a couple of other trails that are available that show you some more drawings and a couple of other caves. We opted to not do those. The Visitor's Center is a few miles away and also worth a visit. Overall a very good place to see. The Park employees are as usual very friendly and helpful. Another example of our tax dollars being put to good use.",

The pass is $30 but good for a week and there's so much to see and do, you could definitely spend a few days here. It was just my son and I so I bought a single \"walk-in\" pass in nearby Tusayan for $15 (kids are free), took the FREE shuttle into the park which bypasses the main entrance and goes straight to the Visitor's Center. From there you can catch more free shuttles to different vistas and lodging. Definitely try to watch the sunset at Hopi Point (red shuttle). Shuttles will be packed but be patient and wait in line instead of trying to walk the Rim trail. It's longer than you think. Catching the shuttle back is like cramming into a Disneyland tram (with ridiculous lines to boot), so just be mentally prepared for long waits. It's worth the sunset view. When you get hot, Bright Angel Lodge serves ice cream at an outdoor shop. Some of the gift shops in the galleries and lodges have items that the Visitor Center gift shop doesn't have. Also, in summer, although it was only 85 degrees, you are at high altitude in thinner air. We walked a (very) short ways down Bright Angel Trail and people were overheating and dehydrated quickly. If you have active little ones, hold onto their hand because there are sheer drop offs with NO guard rails all along the Rim trail and other trails. We also saw elk that walked right up into the parking lots. Pictures cannot capture the depth and magnitude that hit your senses in this amazing place!",

Thanks to other reviews, we knew that we could rent a sled or snow board at the restaurant/shop located just 3-4 miles outside of the entrance to the park. It was $20/day to rent a sled and we rented two for the five of us. It's a toss up if you want to rent one for each person. The cost adds up and you'd have to each carry a sled the whole time but you could bypass a few of the steep climbs required to hand it off to the next person. Park in the dunes lot so you don't have to walk the mile from the Visitor's Center to the trailhead. You will walk through water at the start of the trail so either wear water shoes or plan to take off your socks and shoes to walk through. Don't wear flip flops or sandals- the sand can be hot and it's a lot of climbing. The climbing was tough! We thought we would go to the High Dune but opted for a shorter climb since we were so out of breath. The kids (8, 11, 13) actually stopped and sat down while my husband and I (in our 40's) slowly made the climb to the top. We had the sleds with us and really enjoyed the ride down! Use your feet to help steer so you don't go sideways. If you are going fast and the sled turns, the sled will wedge into the sand and you will go flying. If you go down a steep hill, it's a TON of fun but... man, that walk back to the top is a killer! Bring water! We had two camelbak hydration backpacks and they were perfect. The only negative was that we didn't realize just how sandy we would be when we were done. We were literally covered from head to toe with sand and, since the van was packed and ready for our drive home, we didn't plan a change of clothes. There is a shower area out in the open by the bathrooms that helps get rid of some of the sand but, despite our best efforts, we were still finding sand in our socks, shoes, hair, and underwear the rest of the way home.

They also have park rangers there. There's also a little souvenir shop there where you can watch the sunrise from inside. Probably a lot warmer than standing outside like we did but it was shoulder to shoulder. They do sell some ponchos to keep warm. I always look for shot glasses but unfortunately they didn't sell any.

You can ride your bike (and enjoy coasting down), hike, or simply enjoy looking into the crater. Pack a sandwich and enjoy the day. And here\u2019s an idea especially for your children: Purchase a \u201cPassport to Your National Parks\u201d book (~$10) and each time you visit a national park, your child can get his passport stamped (get one for yourself too)! For an additional $3.00, purchase a \u201csticker\u201d that your child can paste into the passport (both available at the top). This inexpensive purchase could turn into a life-long goal for visiting all our beautiful parks. My grandson loves his! ",

VERY COLD at the top, dont let the sun fool you, and I dont get cold often. Take a blanket or at least a jacket and wear comfortable shoes if you want to walk around.

The park employees were very helpful and knowledgeable of the history surrounding the sites.

I love photography and my husband is a bit of a history buff so I thought it would be a great place to visit. The town was very scenic and the river view was terrific. I was hoping to get a good photo of the town like the ones I had seen online. However, when I got there I found out that I had to hike up the mountainside to get the fantastic view that I had seen in photographs. This was not something that I was prepaerd to do --so I was a little disappointed. With that said, I did enjoy our visit to Harper's Ferry. The town is walkable and well preserved. There are plenty of signs explaining the interesting history of the area. I learned quite a few things I didn't know --- including the fact that Lewis and Clark were part of the town's story --as well as its role in the Civil War. There was a foot bridge that allowed you to walk out over the river and enjoy the view from there. I also was surpried that the area was part of the Appalachian Trail --with many hikers crossing the bridge and walking through the town. They have an active railroad there and Amtrak trains were running through the station. If nature is part of the experience you are looking for --there is a nice walking path next to the Shenandoah River. There were people with rubber rafts and kayaks in the water--looked like they were having lots of fun. There were ruins on the shore to explore--even tiny sea shells on the sandy banks. There is a fee to enter the park but we didn't have to pay since my husband has a lifetime Senior Pass ($10.00 for anyone over 62).This fee includes parking --and we were able to find parking easily during our weekday visit. I don't know if this would be true on weekends and during the summer vacation months. While we were visiting there were plenty of school kids visiting, too. Another thing to keep in mind -- the town is on hilly ground---you may have to walk up steps or down steep streets to see some places. However, I think you could explore some of the area without too much steep walking if you needed to avoid it. We walked up the steps near the church and it wasn't too bad --the view back over town was pretty nice. Overall , Harper's Ferry is a nice trip for anyone who is interested in American history --and also enjoys being outdoors in a scenic spot.",

The lava glow was underwhelming on the day we went, not much to see. The level changes all the time, and the park rangers monitor the level so you'll know if it will be good or boring. They can also tell you how to see lava outside of the park, we went to the end of hwy 130 and rented bikes to see lava flowing into the ocean (do that if you can!!).",

We stopped along the way for pictures. I would highly recommend buying the trail guide for this hike at the gift store in the Visitors' Center. It is only $2 and added a lot of interesting facts to what we were seeing while hiking. We also were able to attend a Ranger 1 mile hike as soon as we got there. Another item I would highly recommend. It gave us a good background while on the rest of our hikes/site seeing during our trip. Of course, the highlight is the actual caldera. The first day we were there you could see the lava spurting up a little bit during the day which we were told is highly unusual. We went both nights to see it and that was spectacular. Each night was slightly different so I'm glad we went twice. The lava and the glow was much more visible at night. Unless you have a really good camera, the pictures don't do it justice.

We saw the moulten lava leaping up in the distance. Do take a long lens camera and a jacket as there is more than a 25 degree Farenheit difference between Kona and the mountain. Many years ago it was possible to get closer by car. Take a look at the steaming bluffs and the Thurston lava tube while you are there. All this will take a couple of hours.

Then we drove round to Thurston Lava Tube. There are various short walks or longer walks depending upon what takes your fancy. We did the Chain of Craters Road which I recommend. It is 61kms return and there are various points of interest to stop. The Ranger at the end of the road was very informative and he pointed out Nene there. This drive took a couple of hours but that will depend on the number of stops and how far one wants to walk. Upon our return we went to the Jaggar Museum and outlook. The Museum was interesting. This was the point where we watched and waited for nightfall to watch the night glow. Definitely recommend staying for that - incredible sight. We managed to find our way around with the maps provided and only had the one day here.

We drove from Kailua-Kona to 7 mile before Hilo then had another 22 miles to Halapana. This took about 3 1/2 hours of driving. Once at the end of the road there were many vendors renting bicycles. We chose one that had many bicycles to choose from at a flat rate of $20. They came with lights for the bicycles, headlamp, a bicycle lock and a medical kit. They were very nice. They take credit cards. It is about 3 1/2 to 4 mile bicycle ride or hike to the end of the gravel road to where you park your bike. The bike ride had a few small hills but you won't have any problems if you're in somewhat decent shape. We made in about 25 minutes. From there it is an easy five minute walk over domed styled lava (vs the sharp edged lava) to the viewing area. The area to view is about 1/4 mile from where the lava enters the ocean. It is a once in a lifetime opportunity and must not be missed. The best part is when you wait till the sun goes down to capture all the beauty. Riding back in the dark was a bit difficult and some people were walking bikes. It was then another 3 1/2 hours drive back to Kona. People told us that night that the National Park Service was telling them to come to the county side because there was so much smoke from the park side. The prevailing winds tend to blow northwards. There are no bike rentals from the park side and the hiking is 5 miles each way over very difficult terrain.

It was so exciting but believe me it does not compare to taking a boat tour with Lava Ocean Tours and getting up close and personal with the lava. It was awesome, fantastic and a once in a lifetime experience. We drove chain of craters road as before but this time we used an app called Shaka Hawaii so we stopped at a Crater we didn't know existed and there's no signage either! This app is $4 and totally worth it. Always thrilling to visit just more so this time with the lava flowing.",

On the way there, it was nice to see the change in vegetations from rain forest to barren earth with lava rocks all around you. The sea arch as well as the entire coastline are quite impressive to see. There are bathroom facilities as well as a booth at the end of the road that sells snacks and memorabilia. We then drove back up and parked at the Lava Tube. There, we began our counter clock-wise hike around the crater rim. We took everyone's advice and got on the Hilauea Iki trail, which is beginner to intermediate level. We did not purchase the $2 brochure like most people did, simply because we did not have any dollar bills on us (an oversight on our part). We did, however, stop at the Volcano House for a light lunch, about a mile into the hike. The view at the restaurant was simply breathtaking. After our light meal, we continued our hike on the Kilauea Iki trail and descended down to the crater. It was raining off and on, and the trail was a bit muddy and slippery, but it didn't really bother us. The plants and fowls along the way kept us intrigued. When we finally got down to the crater, we spent some time taking in the scenery there. The feeling standing at the bottom of the crater with fresh lava rocks and steam coming out of the earth can only be described as surreal. The ascend back up to the Lava Tube did not take long at all. Overall, we spent 6 hours at the park, and we highly recommend it.",

The geologic formations are spectacular, breathtaking views of the valley, lots of places to stop the car and take it all in and get pics. There were restrooms fairly frequently along the way, which s not common in many parks of these types so that was a plus. I'm not a hiker or camper so I can't speak to those aspects.

You can visit the ranch originated in late 1800s. The staff there is very friendly and will explain and show you something about life back in the old days. The LBJ ranch tour takes you across the Pedernales river, passing by the boyhood home, family cemetery and LBJ's grandfather's house. Then after you make the loop you reach the hangar where the president's plane is presented. If you want the tour of the Texas White house, it is $3 for adults and free for kids. It takes about 30 min and our park ranger was Patrick. He was very knowledgeable and introduced out to many details about President's and Mrs. Johnson's lives. You get a glimpse of a 60's era since the house was restored to look like it's from the period when LBJ was a president. I am so happy to have visited this place and learned something about history of TX and the US. Would highly recommend it! It's worth your time and money! ",

This tour takes you through his one room school house, where he loved to learn and was influenced later in life to push for education legislation. The pioneer farm is a working farm, complete with animals and volunteers in period dress, performing period tasks. The ranch is a working ranch. You see family homes, cabins, a show barn with livestock, airplane hangar, cattle herd, and you get to tour his personal residence, the Texas White House.The home has been meticulously restored to look as it did during LBJs presidency. Even though the home was modernized, Lady Bird kept the furnishings appliances, linens, and art work so that the home could go back in time upon their deaths. This self guided tour comes with a perfectly time audio CD to take you through the sights (provided you drive the posted speed limit!).

A typical family of 4 would pay $20 to enter, and $5 for each tour. If you visit their 3 popular ruins, that means $20 x 3 plus the $20 entrance. They aren't making this affordable for the average working class family.

The vegetarian chili was delicious and gluten free! Sonja, our tour guide, was awesome and did a great job narrating the tour. The artisan on board was great too.

The mansion is well maintained and authentically furnished. There are some very interesting things to see in the museum so take your time and enjoy it. I suggest you sign up for the tour of the mansion first and then use your waiting time to view the video and soak in the museum around your tour time. There is a $4 entry fee, unless you have a National Park pass that covers admission. If you have the time, consider visiting the Morristown Commons and nearby Jockey Hollow where Washington's troops encamped during the winter of 1779-1780.

Waited in a long line for the audio tour \"wands\" and was thrilled that my kids really enjoyed listening to it! ($15 for a family of 4). I'd totally recommend the presidential trail. I'm not physically fit, and it was an easy walk with tons of places to stop and rest (and listen to the audio tour). Be sure to bring a water bottle with you, as there is no water along the trail. The very end of the trail includes some long stairways back to the top. I found those a bit tiresome but still worth it. If you have a stroller or a wheelchair the first half of the trail is accessible, but not the second half past the memorial. If you want a closeup view of the memorial but don't want to do the stairs, I'd recommend the first half of this trail before turning around. Overall a successful visit that was extra enjoyable because of the natural beauty of the trail and added value of the audio tour.",

It is exceptional. Loved the drive there, was so damn excited as we exited every bend in anticipation of a first glimpse. The whole place sums up a true iconic American experience for me - a piece of extraordinary architecture, craft and guile, in a stunning 'great outdoors' setting. Will live with me forever and I hope I can afford to return one day. The parking fee of $11 is of course totally worth it, and the easy trails allow you to get a lot closer than I would have expected, with great photo opportunities. Bring binoculars as well to zoom right into these 4 famous faces. ",

It was a gorgeous day that added to the beautiful surroundings. I loved walking down the Avenue of Flags with all the state flags & seeing the mountain. We took the Presidential Trail that goes to the base of the mountain. Visited the Sculptor's Studio & museum. It's $11 a car to park & good for all year. There is no admission other than parking. We went back a few days later for the evening program & lighting of the monument. Very patriotic. If, for some reason, you don't want to pay or aren't interested in anything else, you can see the mountain from the road. There is even a pull off to read about the sculptor & take pictures. I didn't eat at the cafe, but I did check it out though because the cafe & Mount Rushmore is in Hitchcock's movie \"North by Northwest\" that I watched just before visiting. My husband & I thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Mount Rushmore.",

Be sure to walk along the Presidents' Trail. There are many steps, but it's so worth the effort to see all the different vantage points of the mountain carving. Along the walk, there are spots where you are only seeing each particular president, and the views are just amazing! Be sure to watch the movie about the making of it, too...so interesting!

There were alot of stairs at the end so if you want to skip them you can walk the first half of the trail and turn back and still see all the best stuff. We stopped for lunch in the cafe afterward.

Parking is only $11 per car, and your permit is good for the entire year! Breakfast was the first thing on the list as we arrived early, and the Monumental Breakfast did not disappoint! Reasonably priced at only $5.50, they load up your plate with eggs, breakfast potatoes, biscuits and gravy, and your choice of sausage or bacon. The staff were all friendly, one lady even stopped to talk with us for a good 10 minutes. The weather was perfect, sun block is definitely recommended if you plan to walk the Presidential Trail, which is a must. You get a much closer view of the monument, and some great excercise too. They have tour guides and presidential reenactors whom you can have your picture taken with as well. The only complaint is that for being such a patriotic facility, infringing on the Bill of Rights seems un-American..due to this we did not visit the museum or sculptor areas. Change that and I would give it 5/5. Either way it is a must see, whether you live in South Dakota or South Carolina, make the trip!",

You can stop along the road leading up to Mount Rushmore to take pictures, I doubt this would be possible in the \"on season\". Take the road leading to the other side of Mount Rushmore to get a picture of George's profile. For $10.00 you can also go back at night to see it lit up, we did it and it was pretty cool.",

The first one is a mild hike down about 40 minutes depending on how fast you are. Don't rush! Take your time to soak in all the beauty. From the top you would never know what true natural beauty is until you venture to the bottom. If you wanted, you have the option to hike from the bottom of the canyon through all of the bridges and then back up at the third. The second bridge is the most hidden and beautiful. Especially in the fall months, the colors are unlike any I have ever seen. Just beautiful. This is a great place to visit for a long weekend to get away. The other great thing about this national monument park is how dark it is. Natural Bridges was coined the first International Dark Sky Park. I didn't quite understand what that meant until the fire was out and I couldn't see my hand in front of my face...literally. Looking towards the heavens we were speechless from the beauty above. I don't think any of us were expecting to see The Milky Way that close and visible. I would not only suggest but encourage everyone to see this amazing site as soon as possible. If you are an avid outdoorsman I would suggest the America The Beautiful Pass which gets you into more than 2,000 territories in the United States.",

There were two men in one of the huts making tools and weaving leaves. We wove little fish with the park ranger's father, who was totally adorable!!! We had a picnic lunch at 12:45pm by the neighboring swim area (no need to move your car btw). Then, using $7 snorkel masks we picked up at an ABC store we jumped in the water and snorkled until 3pm. Dont miss the snorkeling!!!! The water was calm, no need for flippers (children would benefit from the added control) - you float with little effort and it was easy to stay away from the shore coral/ rocks. Angel fish, puffer fish, parrot fish, the list goes on and on. Blue coral, green, etc - lovely! Headed back into the park afterwards to see if any green turtles had come to shore - two were there, sunning themselves not 10 feet away. We left and made it home well before sunset (4pm). ",

Go there for a day trip! Make sure to buy a plastic saucer for dune sledding in advance to save yourself some money, because you will definitely want to go sledding down the dunes and the ones they sell at the Visitor Center are a little overpriced (17 $). You can go for hikes as well, there is a short boardwalk, a 2 mile loop and a 5 mile loop. I did all of them and they were absolutely beautiful but one of the loops is enough :) Bring at least a gallon of water, and lots of sunscreen the white sand reflects the sun perfectly and it manages to find its way everywhere :) Also bring sunglasses and a hat. Personally I was a big fan of playing frisbee on the dunes, its one of those rare times where you can actually jump safely with your entire body to catch the frisbee. If you are interested in wildlife, the earless bleached lizard likes to hide in shade of the bushes between the dunes, with a little patience and a good eye you will definitely find one.

They are getting a sun burn ;) YOU are going to get out, find out the sand is not hot, and it is like powder, you are going to ooooo and aaaaawe. Drink some more water. Get back in the car, go back to the hotel, let the kids swim, take a nap and then about an hour and a half Before sun down head back out to the sand! THIS is when the fun starts. Once the sun heads downward the temp drops fast to a very comfortable mid 80's...The sledding is excellent and you don't drop dead. As the sun sets great family photos are so possible...and the Frisbee is excellent, toss the Frisbee to those sliding down the dune! It's great. The park closes at 9 and a park ranger will come by on loud speaker to make sure you don't overstay! This is the best approach in my opinion. You get to see how spectacular the sands are during the day, but evening is the best, the critters come out and you don't roast.

The formations are vastly different and the cave has an interesting history among the American Indian. Well worth the $10 admission cost.

The tour goes down to 220ft and it is 1 1/2 hour tour. Lots of walking, lots of stairs and lots of places you have to bend down as to not to hit your head. Stop in maybe five rooms for talks from the Ranger. Caves are special for their cave formation called the boxwork (looks like honeycomb). Ranger Lauren did a great job of explaining the cave, she had very animated stories and she even through in some humor. Pack a hoodie - it is around 55 degrees in the cave. We were there over the 100th national parks anniversary celebration weekend, so we're able to get in free. It is only like $12.00 to get in though, so super cheap activity to do with the whole family. Great job National Parks! ",

I have written separate reviews of some of the key attractions in the park, but I'm using this review to give a general overview. Firstly, as many have said, you need at least 3 days in the park to do it justice. The $50 week pass, including entry to Grand Teton, is exceptional value, as there are no additional charges once inside. Staying inside the park will cut down driving times, but the costs for this are very high, so you need to balance cost against convenience. Canyon would be a good option as it is very central. We stayed at Grant, which was convenient for the Geysers, but at least a 4 hour round trip to the Lamarr Valley.",

We got to the park early and the sign said no parking in park. FULL! So our options were to catch a bus from Springdale into the park or you can pay an additional $20 to park in a lot near the park. Keep in mind it\u2019s in addition to the park fee itself. Then once in you have to take a bus most everywhere as they don\u2019t allow cars on the scenic route. For us that just stinks as we like to drive at our own pace. The bus wasn\u2019t bad though. There are many stops and they pick up & drop off every 8 minuets I think. We chose to do the river trail which was nice and the little hike up to the narrows which is 2 miles RT. This was crazy too. There is just way to many people to even enjoy the park. IMO do yourself a favor and go to Bryce instead. Zion is way overrated buts it\u2019s beautiful. If you want to see it\u2019s beauty and fight with people all day go to Zion. We visited 6 NP on our two week trip out west and this was my least favorite:-(",

The only part of the park that is accessible without fighting huge crowds to ride the shuttle is the drive through the canyon. The parking lot to the Canyon trailhead was only accessible from the other side of the road, and you could not make a left turn at that point because of the tunnel.. All of the other points of interest in Zion are along the route that is only accessible by shuttle, would you have to drive into town and pay to park to utilize.

It's tucked almost half-way between the two cities, and yet seems to be a world away when looking at its landscape. The drive to the park is spectacular and at one point, the road suddenly turns red, and you feel like you're on another planet. The best thing about this park is the shuttle system. Park your car and hop on the shuttle. From there you could just stay on and see its natural beauty, but you can stop at any point and take in a trail, the visitor's center, the museum, ice cream or lodge. We chose to go to the last stop and take the river trail to the Narrows. We spent some of our time traversing the Narrows and after some debate, we were glad that we all wore tennis shoes and all rented a walking stick. You can obtain sticks and even boots before getting on the shuttle near the parking lot. They're $7 and well worth it. The stick saved me from sinking many times while on this trail. Although the trail is beautiful and the cold water is refreshing, it was a lot of work for someone who's not entirely in good shape and unless you plan to go all the way to Wall Street (where it actually gets narrow), you many want to consider not doing this trail and just sticking to the river trail. We took a lunch to eat while on it and just enjoyed our surroundings. After, we went back to our car and some changed shoes and socks; I kept mine on and I was dry in no time. We then did the Emerald Pools; we were only going to go the the lower pools, but someone along the way encouraged us to go all the way to the upper one. Again, for someone not in great shape, this is not easy considering you are going up with some steep cliffs, rocks, and others behind or in front of you and you have to make your way back down...but we went ahead and went to the top. It was nothing special to be honest. The lower pools at least had a small waterfall. My brother-in-law and niece conquered Angel's Landing in the time we changed shoes and did the pools. They're rock stars. All-in-all, if you don't have a lot of time to do any trails, just drive through as far as you can and take the shuttle up and back down. The scenery out of your window is breath-taking.",

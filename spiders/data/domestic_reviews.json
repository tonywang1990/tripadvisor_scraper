Went to the top of Cadillac Mtn. and finally found a space to park on sat, returned on sun. and could not find any place to park. There is limited pull offs and in some areas, which are one way only, you can park in the right hand lane, which was also iffy to find a place to park if you have difficulty walking. I advise you to stop if you see a spot, because remember it is one way in certain areas so you can not turn around, you would need to re do part of the loop. Also, I stopped to get driving permit at one of the visitors centers which was like 54 steps to the top office, then learned that if you go out of the parking lot and turn right , there is a road that takes you to the top for handicapped access. There are different passes , for my car it was $25.00 for a week pass, For myself, I still prefer the Blue Ridge parkway, especially in the Smokey Mountains.",

It was pretty crowded for a Monday, we thought, until we realized (after circling for a space on Cadillac Mountain) that people had flocked there for the partial eclipse. We're still not sure why, as the viewing there isn't any better than anywhere else, but I guess to say you were on Cadillac during the eclipse. So, we were on Cadillac for the 2017 eclipse. lol. The scenery all through the park is gorgeous. If you can only go once, and you want to drive, take the Park Loop Road, and stop at all the places you can. If you want to take the loop only once, make sure you stop at Sand Beach, Thunder Hole, and all the others in the one-way section. We went back the following Friday, hiked up the Bubbles, visited Sand Beach, revisited Thunder Hole, and had a great time. If we go back some day, it would be great to take a carriage ride, maybe. The free shuttles from the Visitor Center are very convenient, although we didn't use them. The parking pass was $25, but it was good for a week, which is perfect for vacationers. Bar Harbor is 5 minutes away, with nice restaurants, shopping, etc. Great trip.",

We went back to the visitor center when it was time to get on the shuttle bus and visit the two small houses that are the birthplaces of the two presidents and then the house at Peacefield where they lived later.

What a surprise to find out the tour for myself and 2 kids was only $5! The entire tour takes about 2 hours. There's an opportunity to watch a short film in the visitor's center if you arrive early enough. It was well done and worth watching, not to mention helpful while taking the tour. We then got on the trolley and visited the birthplaces of John Adams and John Quincy Adams. The Park Service broke up the visitors into 2 smaller, more manageable groups which works really well considering the small rooms we walked through. Loved Peace Field where John and Abigail lived. You could visualize the large extended family living under one roof. There's an impressive library out back, complete with Mendi Bible used for the inauguration of our current Governor. My 13 yr old son was on crutches for this tour and managed quite well as there was only one trip up a flight of stairs to a second floor.

We are a family of history and national park buffs, so this was perfect. The only problem is lack of signage. Even with nap and gps we had trouble finding the park headquarters (and starting place for the tours). The headquarters is on the first floor of an office building housing Quincy College and law offices. We expected a free standing facility and actually drove by the place several times. While there is parking in a garage behind this building, it is not easy to locate. If you manage to get there, take your parking ticket into headquarters and they will validate it for free parking.. It is a small headquarters with the obligatory movie (pretty good) and small gift shop. That is it. The tours begin at this site and you can not join at other spots. The cost was $5 pp. The group goes first to the two homes (adjacent to each other) which are the birth places of John and John Quincy Adams. You visit each on guided tours.You can not visit the sites individually or on your own. From there, you travel on the trolley to PeaceFields, a much larger home with beautiful gardens and separate library building that belonged to the former Presidents and their descendants. The guided tour there is about an hour. Each guide was very different, but knowledgeable in their individual ways. Unfortunately it rained at the last stop, so we could not enjoy the gardens.",

There is a parking garage behind the Center, though it's kind of confusing as a good deal of the spaces are marked \"reserved\" for local business employees. Head up to the third level for visitor parking. And take your garage ticket to the Visitor Center with you - they will stamp it so your parking will be free (otherwise, it will cost you $4-5 to park for the lengh of a tour.) The tour costs only $5 and starts at the Visitor's Center with a movie (about 15 minutes). A trolley picks you up from there and drives your group to the first two Adams homes, and then to another site where the third home is located. The homes are very interesting to see, and the tour guides - as the National Park Service rangers usually are - are wonderful and very knowledgeable. Allow about 2 hours for the tour, plus extra waiting time for the next tour to start (there is a gift shop in the Center to keep you busy). I believe the tours run every hour. The only negative thing I can say is that we weren't encouraged to walk around the gardens at Peacefield (the third home), though I believe you are allowed to if you want to. If you are looking for a meal or snack before or after your visit, I recommend Gunter Tootie's across the street from the Visitor's Center for a yummy sandwich, salad, or pastry.",

They stand next to one another, preserved for posterity in a busy residential area. They have been restored to appear as they did during Adams' occupancy. Some furnishings are original as the homes remained in the family until donated to the Park Service. You tour each home, which takes less than 30 min. total. You then get back on the trolley to drive 10 min. to tour the home John Adams bought later in life and lived in until he died. This home is exquisite and contains numerous family furnishings. You get a real sense of how they lived. I highly recommend that you read David McCullough's Pulitzer Prize winning book \"John Adams\" before you visit, as it will offer great insight into one of our greatest Founding Fathers and most under-appreciated Presidents. John Adams arguably did as much or more to secure America's freedom as any man, including Washington. Unlike Washington and Jefferson, Adams was not born rich, but he was determined to gain independence. A great American! John Quincy's youth in Paris with his father during the Revolution inspired him to become President, too. The first father-son Presidents. Go see where it all started.",

Do not forget to get your parking ticket validated at the National Park desk when you buy your admission ticket! We were with the first group of 10 for the first tour of the day at 9:15. Some other members of this group told me that availability of the tours is limited and tour groups take availability first. The others in our group had called the day before to check for an open tour time. I just showed up at 8:30 and sat on the Park Service doorstep and got lucky. My daughter (age 11) and I enjoyed the tour very much. Staff very knowledgeable. Plan on two hours. If you want to stay and walk around the grounds at Peace Field, you can, but must wait about 30 minutes for the next trolley. Adult ticket was $3.50, my daughter was free.

The guides at both locations provided a lot of information, though the guide at Peacefield was outstanding and very personable.

Once you pay for the tour at the visitor center, $5/adult, under 16 yrs old - free, they provide the trolley to the sites of the three houses. Learned alot about the Adams family on this tour. The tour guides we had were very knowledgeable. As expected, they don't tell you much about the conflicts & problems the Adams' had in politics & other areas. but you do learn about many of the good things they accomplished. You spend about 1/2 hr each on the guided tour of the first 2 houses, see first floors only. & about 1 hr at the Old house, where you go thru 1st & 2nd floor of the 3 stories, plus the Library building. Take your pictures outside when you can, because they move you along rather quickly to the next tour or next trolley. The history alone in these houses, makes it worth while to vist all 3.

On our way to the island, we saw a few humpback whales and when we arrived to Anacapa, we also saw a cute little sea lion on the pier. We continued with the wildlife cruise after dropping off several passengers and we toured around East Anacapa where we saw the lighthouse and Arch Rock. There were many seals and sea lions hanging out by some rocks around that area. Next, we cruised to Middle Anacapa Island where we saw lots of caves and the areas where different shipwrecks occurred. Along the way to West Anacapa, we saw Keyhole Rock and Frenchys Cove as well. These were the highlights of the tour around Anacapa Island, but one of my favorite moments was on our way back to Oxnard Harbor. We saw a pod of dolphins swimming alongside our boat and hundreds of them just jumping out of the water.

I really didn't know what to expect except I knew to bring a picnic lunch and there were no concessions on the island. When we arrived we saw so many sea gulls sitting on nests. The nests were scattered all over the island and in plain view as there are only low plants/shrubs. Each nest had 1-3 eggs. We saw one chick as it was hatching. Several had baby chicks. They were beautiful. It was fascinating to see so many sea gulls in one place. The views are amazing and Inspiration Point lives up to it's name. The gravel figure eight trail is about 2-1/2 miles round trip. It's an easy walk. There are some slight hills. When the boat docks you do have to walk up about 150 steps to the trail. Do not miss this. They say there are different times to go to the island - spring has the flower blooms, late May/June has the sea gulls. There are also sea lions and seals to watch as well.

You will have the option to walk the grounds for free or take a driving tour. The driving tour is 10 dollars per vehicle or 5 if you are flying solo. The driving tour (Recommended) is 11 stops and hits all the highlights. You have the option to do this at your own pace. There are several signs and monuments along the way for your enjoyment and education. Make sure to walk along 'Bloody Lane', climb the watchtower and learn about the Irish Brigade, and see Burnside's Bridge. If time allows, get out and walk around the National Cemetery at the end!

From an historical perspective- it is the place where the bloodiest battle of the Civil War took place. To understand the events that occurred here- start your visit with the movie that is shown on the half/hour at the Visitor's Center. The movie does a good job in helping you put the events into order. Stop in the gift shop and pick up the audio driving guide. This will give you detailed information at each stop. The park rangers often give lectures and tours- so check their schedule. This is largely a driving tour. Each stop is well marked. At each stop you can get out and visit the site. Many of the sites have hiking trails that take you into the woods, fields or other places. These hiking trails range in length from short and easy to long and moderate. A list of hikes can be found on the National Antietam Park website page. Most people never ventured onto the hiking paths, and that is a mistake. The hikes are gorgeous. For those who are history buffs, they really help you gain an accurate perspective, for those into nature- the flowers, butterflies, deer and other animals make it exciting. The most disappointing part of the battlefield is the yet unfinished Burnside's Bridge. Because of the construction- which looks nowhere close to being finished- you can see the bridge, but you can not access it. On your way out of the park, stop in town at Nutter's Ice Cream for the best deal and best tasting ice cream around! The park is less visited than Gettysburg, and that is a huge PLUS- it gives the visitor a chance to reflect on the implications of the battle and to enjoy the beauty of nature without being surrounded by tons of people.

This visit included a stop at the Pry House -- General McCellan's Headquarters during the battle -- which is now open and features a medical history of the Civil War era. In conjunction with the Civil War Museum of Medicine in Frederick, MD, we found the staff at the Pry House quite knowledgable and anxious to tell the story of the medical side of the Battle of Antietam (Sharpsburg). A suggested contribution of $5 per person is totally worth the money and offers a different focus on the battle. Burnside Bridge is now totally under re-construction so that part of the battlefield is definitely worth driving but obviously crossing the bridge is not going to be part of your trip for awhile.

The Visitor's Center charges $10/adult through the National Park Service for a brief museum and film and literature that guides visitors to the 11 stops that chronicle the accounts of the fateful day in September 1862. At each stop, I recommend you park your car either on the side of the road or in parking spaces provided, so that you can get out and read the informational signs as well as get a feel for the crucial moments of the battle. The driving tour begins at Dunker Church, which was locked when my husband and I stopped there. The Cornfield stop enabled visitors to envision the Union army trampling through the field in a wave of fury. The most powerful stop on the driving tour was Bloody Lane. Snake rail fences line either side of the \"sunken road\" that is entrenched between it leading to the brick observation tower. The energies of the fallen are prevalent in this somber place as images of wounded and dying soldiers lay beaten and battered one on top of the other in the red-stained ditch. The Observation Tower gives a visitor the opportunity to embrace the number of soldiers engaged in this bloody battle. With the vastness of the fields sprawled in all directions, one can visualize Lee's 38,000 troops of greys and browns fighting for their lives with McClellan's 75,000 marching forward in navy blues through the haze of gunfire and smoke. Burnside's Bridge is a must-see stop along the battlefield trail as it emphasizes the rushing waters of Antietam Creek below. Hike along the trail that climbs high above the creek, where Georgians held off the Yankees on the bridge for many hours during the raging hours of the day.",

Upon leaving the theatre, we saw that there was already a large crowd waiting to get in, so it's good to get there early. We took the driving tour, consisting of private roads with well marked signs. Several of the stops allowed us an opportunity to walk around on the battlefield. Highlights included the Dunker Church, many memorials to the various regiments that fought here, the original or rebuilt farm houses, Bloody Lane, the cemetery and the Burnside bridge.

I've seen pictures and read about the battle but you have to experience it to really know it. The sunken road, the cornfield, the Dunkers Church, and Burnsides Bridge, when you actually stand there looking at them, all make the story so vivid and so terribly real.

The staff in the visitor's center are very helpful and there are many souvenirs available for purchase as well as restrooms. The souvenirs are all very nice.

A little bit steep, but considering HOW CHEAP it is to get in the center itself it was no biggie. It was only $6 for BOTH of us for three days. Insane. I almost wish they would charge more so they could maybe make some improvements. Sadly this place has not been given the attention it deserves like Gettysburg has, but I hope it does because it should. The museum could be much larger I think...

Because the car tour tries to illuminate too many general facts about the Civil War at each stop, it doesn't do a very good job of actual instruction about the battle. However, since I had read extensively about the battle, being there did help me better understand the geography of the battlefield. If you have time (at least half a day or more), I would advise skipping the CD (which, in itself, cost @ $20) or audio tape and simply getting out at each stop, reading the historical markers and walking the relevant parts of the battlefield. If you have time before going, I would read Shaara's Civil War Battlefields, for a brief (24-page) description or Sear's Landscape Turned Red for an extensive history of the Maryland campaign.",

We bought the $20 CD but found that it was not possible to tell which of the tour stops (numbered on a map) each CD track was talking about, so we ended up not using the CD and wasting our $20. Also, the website said that they encourage people to walk or bike on the self-guided tour, but there is no walking/biking path - one has to walk or bike on the very narrow road used by cars, which would be dangerous ( We saw nobody walking or biking). Also, along the self-guided car tour, there are many roadside signs explaining what had gone on at that part of the battlefield, but these signs were far from the parking areas, and it would have been dangerous to walk on the narrow road from the parking area to the signs. The road was too narrow to park near the signs in order to read them - we would have blocked traffic if we had done so. Very poorly planned out site from the visitor point of view.",

We, too, were initially dismayed at the admission fee, but in retrospect, decided it was more token monetary support to the upkeep of the battlefield than any true financial hardship. At $10 a car, you really can't complain. There was a small demonstration of the way infantry troops advance presented at the center.

If you're going to Antietam, first stop should be the Visitor's Center. They have a film to watch and a nice bookstore. If you want to walk some of the battlefield, go to the bookstore and pick up their $2 booklets for each segment of the battle. The booklets are walking tours of the events of the day; the cornfield, the bloody lane, the bridge, and more. It's good to do the driving tour, but there's something special about actually walking the cornfield and bloody lane that can't be experienced in a car. It was a full afternoon trip to cover the battlefield, so I stayed at the Hagerstown Hotel and Convention Center before heading up to Gettysburg. But, if you have time, go to Harpers Ferry in the morning, then to Antietam. Harpers Ferry is less than 20 miles away from Antietam and it is part of the \"story\" since Confederate troops occupied Harper's Ferry and then made a rush 17 mile foot march to Antietam just in time to provide reinforcement. One other tip, do the Ranger orientation that they conduct at the Visitor's Center. It's only a few times a day, but worth hanging around to listen to the Ranger provide insight.",

We were a group of adults, teens and some youngsters and started at the visitors center. We toured that as it has many historical artifacts, watched a short film and then listened (outside) to a Park Service Guide (Carl) for 40 about 30 - 40 minutes. Carl painted a picture of the events that led up to April of 1865 and really put you there. It was about 95 degrees on the day we visited so I believe we were only there for 1.5 hrs. Had it been cooler, we could have spent about 3 - 4 hours. I did not notice a place to purchase drinks (or food) and there are no stores in the immediate area so I highly recommend packing a lunch/drinks and having a picnic. There is a lot of open space.

The General Store, an original structure, was packed with period merchandise. There is also a park ranger tour. The \"town\" covers a large area and there is a fair amount of walking involved on gravel paths. Even though it was the middle of October, it was plenty hot. Be sure to wear good walking shoes, sunscreen and a hat. Other buildings include the tavern and a munchkin-sized law office The sobering three story jail has a jarringly loud recording emanating from a cell of a \"prisoner\" speaking in a Southern accent so thick it was unintelligible. There is an underwhelming book and gift shop. Welcome picnic tables, paid for by a private foundation provide a nice place to eat lunch. Bring your own food, there is no concession.

He stood in front of a small group of us, comfortably seated outside, and described, often with great emotion, his experience of battle, of losing loved ones & friends, the assassination of President Lincoln.

The 'park' comprises a few buildings including the Courthouse which has since been changed to a museum, giving a taste of what this town was like back in the 1800's. There are a few other buildings including a tavern, lawyers office, and the house where Lee met with Grant to surrender his troops. This was a really good history lesson and the highlight was having the opportunity to chat with the three period actors who sat on the tavern porch. They were delightful and humorous telling stories of life 'back in the day' and commenting on the strange outfits that we tourists were wearing. Just up the street you can stop to see a small cemetery and a couple of other memorials. You can easily go through this area in about an hour to hour and a half. Definitely worth a stop if you're in the area. Bring your National Park Passport Book if you have one and get it stamped in the bookstore. Other things to see while you're here... about 35 minutes away is Lynchburg where yo can see Poplar Forest, Point of Honor, and the old Lynchburg Cemetery. All worthwhile!",

Unfortunately, the Window section of the park is closed for road construction until early September. The park itself closed at 7 pm to 7am from Sunday through Thursday. The visitor's center now has reduced hours from 9am to 4 pm for the rest of the season, starting on August 27. We arrived shortly before 7am on the second day. The weather had been 102 degrees on the first day that we were there so we wanted to arrive early to beat the heat. The park opened up at 7 am. It appeared that only one line had formed but when the park was opened, they let two lines go in. I would recommend forming a second line if there is only one line formed. Then, the attendants waved all the cars through without checking for national park passes or requesting payment, evidently to avoid congestion. The first thing that we did was to hike to Delicate Arch which took us 2.5 hours total trip. Best to do it first thing in the morning before the temperature soared.

While there are many arches and they are dramatic, the other 95% of the park are geological sights only to be seen and experienced; 220+ million year-old eroded, fascinating, all different rock, petrified and tree formations. A two-day visit (that is 3 nights) is my suggested minimum. April is a good month to be there with cool nights and mild days; great for walking and being in the fresh air. Seniors, get a lifetime pass for all national parks and monuments, $10, at the gate or online. Cars, Bikes, Motorhomes and Motorcycles are all welcome and well accommodated.",

Did a 10 mile hike on my 58th birthday there and I am not a hiker. The magnificent views prod even less athletic people like me to keep going just to see what is around the bend. Be sure to take your phone or camera for photos you will always treasure. Hope to return again and do more hiking and spend a couple of days there and at nearby Canyonlands. Check out the Senior Discount Rates available for National Parks. Be sure to watch the quick video at the Visitor Center to get a good overview of the park at the start of your visit.

The view points alone will take a day and there are so many trials to hike. Many of the trials involves rock climbing so you have to be at some level of fitness to tackle them. I would strongly recommend staying at the campsite (Devil's Garden). It cost $25 a night and if you have a senior card, $12.50. Have the right change as the host does not carry change. It is a walk- in only campsite which is great because it would be fully booked all the time otherwise. Best time to check in is around 8 to 9 because I notice that most people check out early if they were leaving. The campsite alone is a great place to hike. There is an arch by the amphitheater and a trail and rock formation within the campsite itself. A herd of 6 deer roamed through my site one morning. The campsite is in Devil's Garden which has a few trails and arches and that would take a day of hiking. The other popular trails are Delicate Arch (an icon), total 6 miles to and from the parking lot, Fiery Furnace (require permit), Klondike Bluff (about 4 mile drive on a dirt road to the trail head) and many others. Just driving around the park on the paved road give you some great views of the various rock formations in the park.

        "text": "Arches National Park is very popular because of the dramatic red rock formations and famous arches. It's only 27 miles from I-70, and compared to other parks, you can see a lot of interesting and exciting sights and desert scenery within a relatively small area. The scenic drive access road to all the features is only about 53 miles round trip. The park can get very crowded and parking spaces fill up. It is best to try to get to the park early and visit the most popular areas first. Try to avoid weekends and holidays. This strategy worked for us; we visited the last week of August and arrived at the park at sunrise. We drove all the way through to Devil's Garden and took a short hike, then stopped at all the features on our way back out. It was starting to get crowded and tour buses were appearing by about 9:30-10:00. We had been to the park before and didn't need a permit for anything, so we waited to stop at the visitor center on our way out. You can get a map with basic geological information about the park at the entrance kiosk where you pay the admission ($25/car, accepts NPS passes). Allow about half a day to see everything - longer if you are going to do some hikes. If you don't have a lot of time, I suggest visiting \"Park Avenue\" and \"The Windows\" as you can see some amazing sights near the road/parking without long hikes. People who use wheelchairs or have serious mobility limitations will not be able to access many of the trails, but fortunately some features can be seen from a car or viewpoint so it's still worth visiting. There is no lodge or restaurant at this park, but it is located just outside the town of Moab, which has all the services you will need. Just bring along some snacks and water. There's a campground in the park at Devil's Garden, visit the park website for information about that. I highly recommend that you take the time to visit Canyonlands National Park as well while you're in the area, and take a scenic drive along the Colorado River on UT128 for more amazing scenery.",

There is certainly not enough parking to cater for the walkers to Delicate Arch (the trail to the arch is badly marked).

We returned to the park in order to take the Fiery Furnace hike. The Fiery furnace tour is great for older families. You MUST be in shape, as there is rock scrambling to do. I am 50+ and was able to do this hike with little difficulty. Tickets must be reserved 6 months in advance through the park service. There were 2 private companies doing tours while we were there, so this might be an option if you can't get on a ranger tour This is a unique experience in the park.

You must carry an drink at least a gallon of water and stop to hydrate often with the high temperatures and low humidity environment. Stop in the visitors center for park information and maps. The history of the park is very interesting to see and experience. There are cafe to have lunch at in the park. Give yourself a day to hike and drive to all you wish to see. Be vigilant of the weather and do not get caught on a trail during a storm, if this happens, seek shelter or get to your car.",

You can spend as much time or as little time as you want in the park. They give you a map and information to give you sample itineraries on what sites to see based on how much time you have, which was very helpful. We stopped at the visitor center and viewed their video introduction which is a great video on the background of the arches. Then you can walk through the little museum before you head out to the various sites. We visited the windows, balanced rock, and Delicate Arch. You can drive by the sites or you can park and hike up to them and view their magnificence up close and personal! If you do that, be aware it is a lot of walking so definitely wear your tennis shoes, wear your hats, and apply your sunscreen. We went in the heat of summer in July and it was hot, with of course, no shade. We are in-shape people, but our legs were still sore the next day as we spent about 3 hours there! Arches is definitely a must-see! We stayed at a hotel in Grand Junction, which is about 1 1/2 hours away, which is a great place to stay over if you're heading toward Denver!",

The entrance fee was $25 and it will give you access for up to 7 days. Unfortunately, it doesn't include access to Canyonlands Park. That will be another $25. From the visitor center, it will take about 20 minutes to drive to the Delicate Arch parking area. The hike up will take about an hour or so. Depending on your conditioning. The entire hike is about 3 miles round trip. I wouldn't say the hike is easy, but it is not difficult. Just take your time and make alot of little breaks on the way up. Make sure you bring good shoes as it can get slippery on some spots. The payoff for your hard work is when you get to the top. ",

Our favorite was Broken Arch, which isn't broken, just has a crack between the two halves. It is not as crowded, requiring a bit of a hike, and you will be able to get magnificent photos with no one else in them if you go early.

Must get out of your car to experience these sights. Ranger said there are 2,000 arches here but only a few can be enjoyed. Many signs to encourage folks to carry adequate water for a hike in the desert. The most rewarding hike we did was to Delicate Arch from the Wolf Ranch. The hike is a bit strenuous but worth all of the effort which comes at the very last second as you round a corner at the top. As a 60 yr. old (out of shape) I had to talk my husband into attempting this hike and he now thinks it was the highlight of our vacation in Utah. We took our time for a rest and water break now and then. The hike goes up over slick rock which is not at all slick. Round trip took us about 3 hours. Best to do early in the day to avoid heat. Saw many families with young children and babies in backpacks. Ranger told us to save the Windows area for best lighting at the end of the day. What a national treasure and demonstration of God's handiwork.",

But bring your own water...LOL. Let's just say it isn't about the amenities. (Utah's favorite sign = No Services) j/k. We were there in August and it was not crowded, no problems parking. It was 105F. We got there early and went back to the hotel in the afternoon. Park Pass good for 7 days. Bring water, snacks, a cooler is helpful, and wear a hat.

Well this year when we flew into Grand Junction we went to Utah at the beginning of our trip. It is about a 2 hr drive from GJ and very worth the drive. When you drive up I-70 take the exit for Hwy 128 to get to Moab. It is a scenic road that follows the river into Moab. A little bit further than just taking the regular route into Moab but worth the drive for the view. It is $10 a car for entrance into the park but it is good for 7 days I believe. We spent about a day 1/2 at the park but could have spent longer but we were meeting friends in Aspen. We got a kick out of seeing what the shapes the the enormous rock looked like to us. Could keep your young kids enthused by playing this game with them. For those going to Delicate Arch the hike is only about 3 miles round trip but I can tell you take plenty of water because it is not a super easy hike. You climb quite a bit and be sure to at least wear some steady tennis shoes. Those that I saw in flip flops it was probably not the easiest hike for you!! The views are breathtaking. If you are afraid of heights once you get up to the arch this might not be easy but you can go get underneath the Arch and have plenty of room without getting too close to the edge. I am definitely coming back another time when I have more time to spend. This is listed as one of the top 25 places to visit in the U.S. and something I can mark off of my bucket list!",

We went in the afternoon and the Landscape arch trail was all in the shade so that helped a lot. And we were able to see all the main highlights in about three or four hours.

The great thing about Arches is you can see great sites from your car, by taking a short walk, or if you so desire you can hike a few miles. While the temperature is hot in the summer, usually 100 or so, we caught a cool spell and it was low 90's. Bring plenty of water, especially if you intend to hike a few miles. Honestly, I have been there at all hours of the day and the early morning is the coolest! For some the red rocks get boring after a half day, but for some the uniqueness of the structures, such as the arches and balance rock, etc.. keeps a lot of people curious and wanting more.

        "text": "This is one of those places that are actually so amazing that they are hard to review. So\u2026start at the beginning! If you happen to be a Senior be sure and purchase your National Parks Senior Pass\u2026a lifetime pass for a one time fee of $10! We really recommend that after you enter the park you stop right away at the Visitors Center. They have water spigots outdoors to fill your water bottles (DO NOT GO WITHOUT WATER THIS COULD LEAD TO A MEDICAL EMERGENCY!) and equally importantly spend a few moments watching the very well done documentary on the park. It is a short 15 minutes and my hubby and I both agreed WELL worth your time! Regarding the water, the park does not sell bottled water so either bring your own or buy their empty containers (not cheap) and fill them outdoors at the spigots. There are also nice restrooms here. Then go into the park and come back later to visit the gift shop for more displays and your souvenirs. So\u2026you came here to see some arches? Get ready for a truly unforgettable experience! Take a few moments to look over the map you received upon entering the park. One could certainly see a lot just by driving through the park, and for someone who may have limits on what they can do physically even doing this would be thrilling. For those who can get out and walk, hike, and explore, by all means do so! The road climbing steeply up from the Visitors Center is not at all shy on scenery. Do stop and read the roadside signs as they tell so much about the history and geology of the region. This park offers something for everyone, and I believe no one leaves here without feeling the immenseness and grandeur of what the natural forces of eons before have done to these mountains and canyons of rock. There is much variety in access to the stunning vistas here. You can park and take your camera and get out and walk a short distance, or you can park, take your water, snacks, backpack, walking stick, hat, sunscreen and go for miles and hours. We happened to be there on a day in summer when the temps were between 99 and 104 degrees, not exactly ideal for hiking, but were not about to miss out so off we went. This is wilderness back country. Take with you what you need i.e. first aide kit, LOTS OF WATER etc. I wore long sleeve pants and long sleeve shirt for protection from the sun. As it turned out I would have been cooler in shorts but since I was not sure how much brush was on the trails I opted to stay safe. The canyon walls hold a lot of heat and offer no shade mid day so be prepared! We hiked down Park Avenue and the scenery was incredible! We were surprised at how few people we saw and truly relished the quiet of this sacred spot. We then returned to the car and drove further into the park in search of some of the famous arches. There were more people here probably because it was a much shorter and less steep stroll, but it was breathtaking nonetheless. This is one of those places where you cannot help but think of your mortality when one compares the short span of human lives to the eons it took to form and shape these rocks. We eagerly look forward to visiting this National Park again. The city of Moab, Utah (population 5,000) is close by and offers easy access to this gem of a park. This is red rock scenery at its finest. Do not miss out! Tip for when you visit Arches: There is no food available for purchase so bring it with you! There are several stores in Moab nearby where you can purchase what you need. Bring snacks as well as something substantial. You will wind up staying much longer than you thought and will be hungry from all the hiking if you don't plan ahead! And wear substantial shoes! My husband and I both wore our hiking boots and were so glad we did. If you know you will just stroll a bit maybe casual shoes are fine but if you wish to hike (and who wouldn't?!) the rocks are slippery and the trails steep so come prepared. Tip for while you're in the area: Another really wonderful activity nearby is a jet boat ride down the Colorado! Great fun for all ages and many different trips are available! This is a perfect companion activity to complement Arches National Park as the Colorado skirts the same red rocks yet offers a completely different (and magical!) perspective. We chose the sunset cruise to get good light for photography and also because it wasn't so hot then! We know you will love everything you do here!",

We started our day so early (arriving around 7:15), that the entrance fee booth and the visitor center weren't even open yet. We were travelling on an Annual Pass, so didn't feel guilty for not paying anyway. 4 hours just wasn't enough to enjoy everything we wanted to see! As others have mentioned, this park has a particularly good mix of driving and hiking. And being there in the morning meant we weren't dealing with major crowds. The only disappointment was not having enough time to hike up to Delicate Arch - the viewpoint just doesn't do it justice, and is itself quite a strenuous climb. We also weren't able to make it up to Devil's Garden, and therefore didn't see Landscape Arch either.

We took the Badlands Loop Road - Highway 240. We came in from the Northeast Gateway Entrance at Catus Flat and took the 40 mile drive through the Badlands. Our first stop was the Big Badlands Overlook. Here we saw a herd of Bighorn Sheep down in one of the valleys. They just kept on eating. We were amazed that we even got to see some! The park is a maze of canyons, buttes,pinnacles and spires. Our stops included Yellow Mounds, Pinnacles, Door Trail, Cliff Shelf Trail, Window Trail, doors and Windows Parking area and Fossil Exhibit Trail. There is so much to see and do here. You will be driving down the road and they just sneak up on you! Our pictures will never do the Badlands justice. We were there late afternoon into early evening. Because we were there off season - the park visitor's center was already closed for the day so we didn't get to have our Park Passport Book Stamped. You can look for miles and miles! It is very scenic. This land is our land - this land is your land! My daughter said this is stuff she sees on Twitter and now here we are!!! Every turn is such an adventure. You can hike on the many trails and go right into the Badlands themselves. They have some paths but many wooden walkways because of the rattlesnakes and so you don't damage the park. As we were driving through, right along the road was a female (ewe) Bighorn just eating the grass. We watched her for several minutes - she just ignored us and kept right on eating. We were able to take many, many pictures of her. We also saw prairie dogs, cottontails, 2 dead bull snakes, mule deer and buffalo on the way through.The Buffalo Gap National Grasslands encompasses the Badlands National Park. We did get to stop at Cedar Pass Lodge Gift Shop for postcards and local souvenirs - This was another great day on our trip across the country and YES I would go back in a heartbeat.",

The visitor center has a great gift shop for some souvenirs. If you have time, drive out towards Sage Creek road ( I think that's what it was called) - it was a dirt road, but it paid off when we got to see a bunch of bison up close and personal.

It's fun, scenic and doable to get off the boardwalk at the Door Trail...the marker poles keep you on track. The ground is uneven and smooth, so wear good walking shoes...no place for flip-flops; would be hard if you had balance or mobility issues or needed to carry a child, but not strenuous. We also enjoyed the Cliff Shelf trail...you do need to climb a lot of stairs to do the whole thing, but get to walk through some shaded areas and the view and aroma of juniper makes it very worthwhile. The Fossil Exhibit trail was ok...short boardwalk with displays. Be sure to wear lots of sunscreen and keep drinking water! Seriously! The heat and sun can really sneak up on you here, with the low humidity and winds. Allow time for the curvy, hilly and crowded loop drive (including RVs).

There is a schedule you can check to find out when they expect the bats to leave the cave for that day. I would recommend getting there a bit early and ensuring your camera is properly set to take pictures WITHOUT the flash. The park rangers will tell you many times that flash photography is prohibited -of course, someone always does not listen and they had to reprimand one person twice and then asked him to leave the amphitheater. So, practice with the flash off or just film it. It is amazing - just a tornado of bats swirling out of the cave. Prior to the bats leaving, a park ranger will give the history of the caverns and the bats -so, it is very informative. Finally, you should make a day of it at the caverns -starting early. And, if you have young kids -sign them up for the National Park Service's Junior Ranger Program (free). They will get an activity book and will be given some tasks for the day -what to see, some questions. If they complete it, you can take it back to the Visitor's Center and they will give your child a Junior Ranger patch. It's pretty cool and keeps the kids engaged throughout the day (and, the parents learn something as well). It cost about $10 dollars for 16 and up -free for kids 15 an younger. This allows you to do the self-guided tour. There are some ranger guided tours for additional fees -many don't allow for children under 12 or 8 -but, some are very cool.

        "text": "The Bat Flight Program is something that everyone should do! It's free and amazing. Get there at least 45 minutes early to get a good seat, although it didn't seem there was a bad seat in the amphitheater. In my opinion, where we sat was perfect; we sat in the 3rd row from the front toward the right side of the amphitheater. The bats are unpredictable, so one must have patience. Also, there are NO CAMERAS allowed. NO PHONES, no nothing! One has to maintain complete silence during the bat's exit because any noise will interfere with the bats echolocation. So, if you have kids that can't be quiet, you have to go stand at the top. There were a few people there who were really rude. One family had a noisy kid and the ranger had to tell them to leave. It was very disruptive to the spectators and the bats. Please plan on being respectful when you go. Also, one guy's cell phone went off toward the end; very rude and inconsiderate. That gentleman was actually issued a ticked from the ranger. The rangers mean business, so just follow the rules. There is a way to obtain a camera permit, but this must be set up prior to the program; contact the park. The bats fly out of the cave anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours, so like I said, patience is the key. They fly out during sunset and the rangers have a system set up to warn everyone when they are about to exit. The ranger who led the program was awesome. She had her hands full with telling 200 + people that they had to be completely silent. She was so passionate about bats and had a lot of information to share. Now listen up, once a year in the summer, they offer a \"Bat Breakfast.\" This year, we attended it on July 20. We got there at 3:30 am and were the second people in line. For the 1st 120 people, they handed out tickets for a free, candle/lantern lit tour down to the bottom of the cavern. From there, you took the elevator up. It was amazing. It was worth it to get up that early. Check the park's website early in the year to start planning your trip around this event. They also give you breakfast burritos (which were pretty good), yogurt parfait, soda or orange juice, and fruit for $7. Oh, and they offered \"bat friendly\" coffee. The bats started coming back in the cave as soon as the sun started to rise. It was amazing. Try and plan your trip around this!",

The problem is that during peak tourist times the park is not user friendly if you plan to drive in and visit for the day. There is very very limited parking if you wish to stop and walk a trail. Also no thought is put into the needs that might arise for tourist. For example if you walk a 2,3 or 4 mile trail there are no shelters or portapotty at either end. There were no distance markers on any of the trails we walk. We went on six trails. The one secondary road that reflected an effort by the park was the Old Dagger Flat Auto trail. At the start of the road was a self guided pamphlet for $1 that referenced 19 obelisk markers on the way in. But the road is very secondary. My wife and I have and will visit many national and state parks; to date this has been the least tourist friendly. ",

We took the \"ferry\" (aka a paddle boat) across from one muddy bank to the other. For fun, we rode the burro into town. We had lunch and a few beers. Our guide was friendly and gave us a nice tour of his town, Boquillas. It helps if you speak a little Spanish and tip a couple dollars when you get into town, not just on your way out.

Outstanding park. Rangers and the lodge staff are outstanding. Lodge is comfortable. No TV, but you can rent one w/a DVD player if you \"civilization lost,\" and can't do without your fix. We didn't miss it at all. The Lodge is comfortable, has a great gift and supply shop, has a restaurant and is busy, busy, busy. To enjoy the park you NEED to stay there. Rates are very affordable. BTW, the park also has a gas station with convenience store and that is a big plus. Yep, more expensive, but when you need gas, you NEED GAS, and having to pay more is \"nuttin'!\" We were there for 3 days and will return.

There are a few areas you can bird because of a long-abandoned ranch or two. The thing is, you drive 40 miles or more to get to a place to find birds and then another 40-50 miles to hopefully find good birding. In between is desert surrounded by mountains of rock. It gets pretty boring if you have ever seen the rest of the Rocky Mountains; obviously, I am not a desert fan. You also have to sure you have a decent place to stay and that is difficult, as the motels are straight out of the 50's and set in sand and dirt. One bright spot was staying at Lajitas Golf Resort. It is truly beautiful. The rooms are comfortable and clean, there is a restaurant, spa, general store and obviously, a beautiful golf course from which you can also rent a golf cart just to see the grounds. That is good for us non-golfers. There are many activities also which you can arrange such as skeet shooting, Old West shooting in an old ghost town, horseback riding, river floats, etc. It is only 20 miles down Hwy. 170 from Terlingua at one of the entrances to the park. Pricey, but well worth it considering the other options. If you are in the Big Bend area, check it out.",

Even on the busiest travel weekend of the year, it still wasn't that crowded. We were able to make our way up to the Chisos Basin without getting stuck behind any slow moving RV's. The campground and lodge were full, of course, but we had already planned on staying in Alpine, TX so it didn't really affect us. The views were amazing both coming into the park & at the top of the Chisos Basin. The restaurant/bar at the Chisos Basin featured beer from a local brewery so that was a nice break after being out in the sun all day. There are hundreds of miles of hiking trail and the roads are so deserted that I wouldn't hesitate to bike in the park with my family (next time we are bringing our bikes!). Be forewarned, this is some of the most remote land in the country so plan ahead fuel wise. There is a fueling station at Panther Junction but you will pay almost a dollar more per gallon due to how remote it is.

You have an option to hire a horse, burro or truck to take you into town. After checking in with customs and getting our paperwork, we hired a wonderful young man named Eduardo as our guide. He took us to the three schools in town, the church, the new clinic and to the \"bath tub\" local hot spring. He answered all our questions and provided many details about the history and make up of the town. He also introduced us to his grandfather as we walked by his home. We ended our tour at the Falcon Restaurant enjoying a beer, cheese quesadillas and bean tostadas. The restaurant owner, Ben spoke excellent English and was a delightful host. We bought a few bracelets sold by the local kids. They were all very polite and respectful. We thoroughly enjoyed our afternoon and will return when given the opportunity.

Day 1 we went to the Lost Mine trail in the Chisnos Mtns and the view from the top was great that day. On the way there was actually snow in the dessert which was a rare treat from what we were told. The trail itself was easy to navigate and had a lot of switchbacks. My 9 year old daughter paced our family the entire time. The view from the top is worth the trip up. The next day we went to the Santa Elena Canyon side of the park via Jeep tour. Probably could have just as easily done this by ourselves like the other areas but wanted to try something different. If you book a jeep tour recommend you make sure that you at least get some back road travel, ours did not. Santa Elena is spectacular as well and there is a short hike back into the canyon. There were several points of interest along the way that we stopped as well. Our 3rd day we went to the Rio Grande/Boquillas area. We took the Boquillas International Ferry (heavy sarcasm but that's what they call it) to Mexico for some shopping and lunch and felt safe and enjoyed ourselves. There is plenty of evidence of illegal border crossing activity as there are many locations that have souvenirs for sale on the US side and a bucket for $ donations. We saw a couple of folks that had canoed across the Rio Grande to sing for the tourists, kind of comical and never felt threatened. There is small cave at the end of the trail that you can climb up to. Kids of all ages enjoyed. ",

        "text": "This was a re-visit to Black Canyon of the Gunnison Nat'l Park...yes, it is worth visiting more than once (as are ALL National Parks, in my opinion). Cost (fall of 2014) was $15/vehicle, good for 1 week. Views into the canyon are awesome (keeping in mind that we've also visited the Grand Canyon, AZ, & Waimea Canyon on Kaua'i). Comparatively, Black Canyon is VERY narrow, so more of a \"straight down\" view than an expansive (Grand Canyon) view. The colors are totally different too, more black/gray/pink at Black Canyon (as opposed to the red/orange of Grand Canyon or Waimea Canyon). The drive along the S rim offers great views, & EVERY viewpoint area is worth a stop. Likewise, it is worth driving down the road that goes all the way to the Gunnison River at the bottom (& there is a small camping area down there). There is a small Visitor's Center, & also a small camping area (you make reservations online) along the rim drive. There is an out-&-back hiking trail that goes along the ridge & affords nice views of the area, which we hiked on a previous visit...can't remember the name of it, but you access it from the parking lot at the end of the rim drive road (the 1 that has all of the viewpoint stops; you can ask at the Visitor's Center). On a previous trip we also visited the N rim, which hardly gets any visitors & is very primitive. There is no bridge connecting the S & N rims, so it is quite a drive to get to the N rim. We wanted to do some primitive tent camping, so it was worth the drive for us, & we had the entire camping area to ourselves. There is no food available in the area (either rim), so bring along a picnic lunch (there are picnic tables scattered here & there along the S rim drive). You can do a really quick drive-thru on the S rim, just hitting the viewpoints, in a couple of hours if that's all the time that you have...but it is definitely worth a more leisurely pace, including a picnic lunch, & spending at least half a day on the S rim. If you want to also see the N rim, you can do that in conjunction with the S rim, but you will need to start EARLY & it will be a long day. Black Canyon of the Gunnison is definitely worth a visit, even if you have to go out of the way a bit to get there. The closest lodging is in Montrose (maybe 20-miles away)...& the best rates are at the Black Canyon Motel (see my review of it) right on Hwy 50.",

At the visitor center, we happened upon a nice volunteer ranger ' Bernie' who had this awesome telescope through which we were able to view a sunspot on the sun! The visitor center had some nice displays and there is a nice short hike right out the back door with great views. We were lucky as well to come in time for a ranger-led educational talk on the geology of the park with 'Paul'. He had us do a 'demo' of the types of volcanic activity with pancake mix, it was fun and very informative. We always try to take advantage of these ranger-led activities, they are always very informative and make the visits to the parks all the more meaningful. We drove the South Rim from the Visitor Center to the end and did the Warner's Point hike which was about 1/3 mile one way and got to see lizards and birds along the way. (Be sure to bring some water). The views at the point were breathtaking as well. The Painted Wall, everything was well worth the time we made to come here. You can spend a short time or a whole day here. It's $15 per car to get in but we bought the National parks annual pass ($80) since we like to go to some other parks too. Seniors get a really good deal on annual park passes. Do make the time to stop here if you're anywhere nearby and check the website ahead of time to find a ranger-led activity in case you can coordinate your day to go to at least one. Be camera ready and binoculars would be great too! Be aware that this area has very limited wi-fi / cel signal and you should check this out before you leave your hotel or residence so you'll have a signal to get to the website.",

I'd recommend to keep going to the other overlooks because they do get better. My favorite was of the Painted Wall. It is basically a flat piece of the mountain that has all different patterns from molten seeping into the surface millions of years ago! I'd also recommend taking the curvy road down to the water.

        "text": "We arrived very early to Bryce Canyon. So early that we had a front row center parking spot looking out from Sunset Point at Bryce Canyon. As we are parked there, you can see the top of the canyon, and as you walk down the short dirt path the canyon opens up and my eyes could not believe the beauty of this canyon. The colors and the formations go on forever and it's almost too much to take in and comprehend just how incredible this place is. There are several different trails, but Sunset Point is very central to them all and a great starting/ending point. Going down the Navajo Trail was quite enjoyable. I loved the switchbacks taking us down through soaring mountain walls to the bottom of the canyon. Stopping to look back and up provided some incredible photos. We were feeling adventurous at the bottom and decided to take the long hike along peekaboo trail. This is a long hike and somewhat strenuous (at least it was for us in our late 50's and not in the best of shape). However if you're fit, and/or young, I think you will find this trail very exhilarating. Passing through tunnels was almost like entering a different world as the views and colors changed. So we took Navajo Trail down, then connected to the Peekaboo Trail and did that round trip and took the Queens Garden Trail back to Sunrise Point. Then a short paved walk along the rim back to Sunset Point. We were here on the very last day of April and were glad we did this at this time instead of the heat of summer. I would highly recommend using well ventilating canyoneering shoes with a good wicking hiking sock. My wife had purchased these and I did not. Her feet were very dry and comfortable after an 8 mile hike, while my feet in my sneakers were sweaty and starting to blister. That night we drove over to Bryce Point for the sunset where there is an overlook above the canyon. Being able to look down on the canyon and take pictures of the path we hiked and get an overall view of the canyon was just spectacular. The hoodoos at this time of day are in their full glory and it's what you see on many brochures and postcards",

I was a little worried that one day would not be sufficient for a national park, but unless you plan on spending a lot of time on the trails, one day is ample time. We arrived fairly early in the morning (around 8:00 am) and made our first stop at Sunset point, since we were only planning on hiking one trail and wanted to do so while it was still cool. I highly recommend completing the Navajo loop trail! It was a very memorable experience, and our younger children (although tired by the end) were able to navigate the trail just fine. After Sunset point, we stopped at Inspiration point, then drove to Rainbow point at the end of the park road. We then stopped at the other pullouts on our way toward the park entrance. On our way back, they had signs and rangers at Inspiration and Sunset points, indicating that the parking lots at those attractions were full. So it seems like hitting those two spots early in the morning was the right thing to do. We didn't have any trouble finding parking anywhere else that we stopped. We had seen everything that we wanted to see (including Mossy Cave, which is not on the main park road, but on UT-12) by about 2:30 in the afternoon. The park entrance fee is $30 per private vehicle, or you can use an interagency pass (we used a fourth grade \"every kid in a park\" pass, courtesy of our fourth grade daughter). Although we experience great weather while we were there (temperatures ranging from about 60-75 F, and nothing but sunshine), be advised that conditions in the park can be dangerous when thunderstorms are in the area (lightning, flash flooding).",

Lodge has a great dining room for lunch (burgers, salads, BLTs, Club sandwiches all for around $10-12 and a hot and cold buffet for $14.15. The General store has self-serve soft serve cones for $1.95 (as much as you can safely put on the cone). We had two full days there. You hike down into the canyon using multiple switchbacks - the great views are from the rim so those who do not want/can't hike can still enjoy Bryce. There are multiple trails but you can see everything you would want to see in 1.5 to 2 days. We also visited Mossy Caves - a short hike from Highway 12 (build in 45 minutes if you have it available). Shuttle system is fine - but optional (unlike Zion where it is the only travel mode during most of the year).

Park your car at the shuttle station, pay $15, and get on the shuttle to take you into the park. Make sure you go to Observation Point, which was the furthest the shuttle was going when I was there (Bryce Point was closed) and then walk back to Sunrise Point and do the Navajo Loop to the Queen's Gardens Trail. Start the Navajo loop counterclockwise and not clockwise as the brochure recommends. This will bring you first to Wall Street (a slot canyon) after descending sharp switchbacks. After that follow the directions of Navajo loop and continue until you see signs for Queens Garden trail. This will take you to Sunset Point where you can get the shuttle to the lodge. I highly recommend signing up for the free bus tour to Rainbow point. It leaves twice a day 9 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. and can pick you up at the visitor's center. It's 3 hours or so and if Spike is your guide, you are in for a treat. On the way back from Rainbow Point you stop at other points of interest to see the hoodoos named after things people about 100 years ago thought the rocks resembled (like the hunter and the rabbit).

Wallstreet was iced over, and too dangerous to hike, but plenty of other areas open to hike. I would recommend wearing the clampons for your shoes, if you dont have any, you can purchase them from the visitor center. They are about $25, but well worth it. There are many hikes that anyone in moderate shape can do. There were people of all ages on the couple of trails that i did. This is our second time here in the winter. We will need to visit during months without snow in order to hike all the trails that are currently iced over. Definitely worth the visit. The trail that I would recommend starts at sunset point down a steep hill into the canyon called the Navajo trail, toward queen gardens, you ascend again towards sunrise point, after the hill there is just a small flat trail back to sunrise point. The canyon was amazing with, arches, bridges and doorways through the rock. The entire walk was beautiful. ",

If you get the chance and are going to be within 100 miles of it, make sure you add it to your agenda. Oh - tip for all - get a National Park Pass if you are going to more than one National Park - saves money.",

        "text": "We spent a full day of our week long \"canyon exploring vacation\" in Bryce Canon NP. We spent our previous 3 days in Zion Canyon NP. (Be sure to buy the $80 annual NP pass if visiting numerous National Parks) Bryce Canyon NP was SO COOL! With Bryce Canyon you start your hiking adventure from the top of the canyon. From the top looking down, everyone looks like little ants winding their way down the MANY switchbacks. We went counter clockwise down Navajo Loop trail into the bottom of the canyon and had a little granola and water break with the local chipmunk. (He is so funny watching and climbing up onto the stump wanting some or your crumbs. Don't feed them, just enjoy watching them and get a laugh.) We then hiked out the Queens Garden and was going to continue the loop up to the top of the canyon. However, we wanted more. So we returned to the bottom of the Navajo Loop and went out the Peek-a-Boo Loop. This loop was a little strenuous and was hot BUT it was AMAZING! (There were shady spots along the way) I am so glad we added this loop to our day's hike. It had some amazing views from different heights. We returned from Peek-a-Boo to the bottom of the Navajo Loop and went up the left side (the side we had not yet done). It was filled with switchbacks and sights and shade. The entire canyon reminded of the sand dripping castles we made as kids at the beach. The top of the canyon and hike down was cool and in the 70s but the hike out to Peek-a-Boo got quite warm. Dress in layers and take snacks and plenty of water. We visited in mid-September on a Tuesday 11-6. Have FUN!! ",

There are also shuttles that run continuously and you can get on and off at any of the picturesque stops. Hiking any of the many trails into the canyon is a different experience than viewing from above. Each is truly memorable. My husband and I hiked over 16 miles of trails and loved it.

Not many easy hikes other than the rim walks that give you amazing views for over 30 miles. It was fun to sit in the sun and be cooled by the cool wind blowing out of the canyon. The Navajo Loop was our hike of choice as it allows you to hike in and around the hoodoos, through a few small archways, under 1.5 miles and we had some tires little legs with us. Though many do this hike it is not an easy hike lots of elevation change walking next to drop offs and hiking in loose footing. Bryce Canyon Point Natural Bridge and Rainbow Point are all worth the drive to see. The day we went the rangers had a telescope for us to look at the sun through... we were skeptical to say the least. They had a filter that allowed you to do this without burning your eyes out. Unique opportunity to see the sun, it appeared red and you could see sun flares.

There are two shuttles, one a three hour guided free guided tour that starts at the Bryce Canyon shuttle staging area opposite Rubys and goes to Rainbow and Yovimpa point. These are the farthest points towards the south of the park (40 miles round trip). To get on this shuttle you need to reserve a place by calling 1 435 834 5290.

A real treat for me as I have only seen it during the dry seasons before. The winds can be quite fierce at some of the overlooks so if you go in winter and through May, take gloves, coats and cover your head. Regardless of when you experience Bryce, it is truly that, a unique experience that you will remember the rest of your life. As always, a good camera with fresh batteries is a must as you will stop and marvel at the creations before you. Limited number of toilets. Bryce is a 15 mile long, one way in and one way out drive. There is a campground and small lodge but accommodations, fuel and food are before the park entrance. A must see attraction! Fee as for all National Parks is $25.00 per auto and includes up to 4 persons.",

We used a lot of TA reviews and pointers to figure out if we were going to drive through the park and pull off at overlooks or if we were going to add in a hike. It is easiest to see the park by stopping at the park entrance/information center, getting a map, and then driving to the one of the further away over looks as most of them are on the left hand side of the road. We drove about 20-30 mins, turned around and then began stopping at the overlooks. We visited the park after lunch time so we missed the sunrise at Sunrise Point, however it was still beautiful. We parked at the Sunrise Point parking area and did the Navajo Trail from there to Sunset Point. The trail was steep at points and is about 3 miles. In the beginning of the trail it is a steady hike down and then you're on part of the canyon floor. On the way back up to Sunset Point, you are climbing back up to the rim and that was the hardest part of the hike. Leave yourself about 2 hours to do it and also let yourself rest in between difficult parts. Definitely a great hike and you get to see so many hoodoos and rock structures. There is a $25 fee for entrance to the park, but with the America The Beautiful Pass ($80 p/ year), you can enter for \"free.\" If you plan on visiting 3-4 parks on your trip, the ATB pass is a wonderful deal and you're contributing to our national parks.",

It's difficult to find and may require you to head off the trail somewhat. Navaho is moderately stressful, elevating 500 feet up to 8,000 feet, so you may need to stop before reaching the top.

The only other place on earth like it is somewhere in Turkey. Bryce is technically not a canyon, because there is no river. We went to Bryce for the hiking. We went in the fall so as to avoid the summer crowds, but it turned out to be busy then too, with older people (like us) and foreigners. I didn't think it was too bad, and because we did some of the more difficult hikes, we saw fewer people. There is a shuttle system in the park, but you can also use your car if there is room in the parking lots. We had no problem with that and did both. The in-park lodge is very nice, but we were happy with our less-expensive accommodations at the nearby Bryce Canyon Pines. I would also recommend the free narrated bus tour, which we did the first day to get the lay of the land. You sign up at the Visitors Center. I thought this park was the more unique of the two we visited this trip (we also went to Zion). Pay attention to weather averages because it can be colder here because of the elevation (8,000 feet), also be aware that elevation can cause problems if you are not prepared for it. Most of the viewing of Bryce is from the rim, but you can hike down into the canyon as well. If you are a senior citizen you can buy a Golden Pass, giving you free entry to all national parks. I would also suggest spending several days here. We spent three days.",

Wear good hiking shoes - I can't stress that enough! What is great about this park is that it is only 80 miles from the Grand Canyon, so if you visit one, it is no too far to go to the other. Zion National Park is also in the area so go there if you can, too! Get a yearly pass from the Park Service to get the most out of your dollar.

The views of the Hoodoo's & surrounding canyon are amazing! These are views you will never see anywhere else. I suggest driving to the last point-Rainbow-& start there. This will give you less traffic to deal with & all the points are on that side of the road so easier access as well. The park has shuttles which take you to each point & they really push this mode of transportation to protect the park. The only problem is the shuttle starts 8am & stops at 7pm. We drove because we started our hike early morning & we stayed in the park for sunset during our drive of the scenic tour. We viewed the sunset from Inspiration Point & it was gorgeous. You will not only have great views of the canyon but may also see wild-life on your drive. The entrance fee to the park is $25 & open 24 hours a day. There are restrooms at some of the points.",

That is why you will see dozens of European & Asian countries represented to experience this God's gift to man! Whodo's, spires, pinnacles, fabulous hiking trails and more. Always take a huge shade hat, a big neck towel in the summer to wet and stay cool, plenty of water & energy snacks. A minimum of 24oz even in the winter and 48oz in summer. Always have anti-slip shoes, & it is highly recommended to have some great Liki Summit shock poles to take the stress off your knees & feet. They make the down hill and up hill, so, so easy on your body. Weather old or young you have to try great hiking poles if you are going to do a hike with 200' to 800' elevation changes like the ones in Bryce Canyon. I love those Austrian made poles which are around $100 at Sport's Chalet. They have the most shock which really helps pushing you up and down the Wall Street & the Queen's trail hikes. Without poles you better be young and in good shape. The weather was around 45*F which was fabulous for hiking. You never broke a sweat. I was there hiking a dozen trails year's ago in mid-August and it was around 100*F, and beastly hot to hike. I sure could of used my old US Army cool down kerchief's and wet towels. The sand stone just radiates the heat back in your face. A huge shade hat and tons of sun screen with save you from being burnt to a crisp which most of the novice hikers were every time I have been here. If you go that time of year start your hikes at sun up. The sun's rays are so intense. The elevation will get to you if you have breathing problems. It is over 7,000' to 9,000'. I did have problems sleeping at Ruby's Inn due to the elevation. Of all my hikes from Mittenvald Alp in Germany, to Switzerland and the forests of Yosemite & Sequoia California National Parks, I rate the geologic splendor of Bryce Canyon & Zion National Parks the two places you must visit before you die. If you just drive to the dozens of pull-off view points and take pictures, it is fabulous. If you are handicapped don't let this hiking turn you down. There are great ramp areas to see. If you have breathing problems, just take your portable concentrator, which I saw several. I took my Albutoral and it was fine. The roads are excellent with speeds to 65mph. The only slow and low area is the narrow Zion tunnel which they had to make one way for some big motor homes when I was coming back. On this tour from Las Vegas you get to see Zion too which has a nice shuttle bus and a handicap trail. Just do it! If you have only one place to see in the entire USA, go to the combo-Zion & Bryce Canyon National Parks. Go on-line and you will see if it is for you. I have been there three times in my 50yrs of traveling all over the world and I still come back to get close to nature and the incredible fresh air of Southern Utah.",

Odds are, no matter where you are driving from, you will see your fair share of beautiful scenery along the way. The reason we chose this time of year to visit Bryce was so we could see the famous Utah snow draped atop the canyon. We made our way past Arizona, St. George (UT), and Zion National Park (visited Zion only two weeks ago) to one of the many entrances to the Dixie National Forest. The forest is home to some of the most beautiful scenery I have ever seen. Taking pictures a plenty, we would sooner or later get onto UT-89, and from there drive straight to Bryce Canyon. Because we were visited the park on Veteran's Day, the park was free of charge. It is usually $25.00, but it is most certainly worth it. The visitor's center holds an award-winning film that explains the history behind the canyon. Believe me when I say, that had my wife and myself not seen the film, we would have left the park later that day with more questions than answers. The film is free, so you might as well sit back and relax for twenty minutes, while you absorb the enigmatic background of Bryce Canyon. There are two different experiences you can take while driving through the park. A drive to Bryce Point and back is about four miles both ways. A drive to Rainbow Point and back (passing other major view points) is about seventeen miles both ways. When we got to Bryce Point, a Stellar's Jay (which we seen during the film) landed in a tree only about a couple of feet from where we were standing. We were able to get some really nice close-ups. We then walked the trail to one of the most scenic vistas anywhere, Bryce Point. I cannot even find words to explain it, other than unimaginable. At Bryce Point alone there are an incredible amount of different types of formations, but the biggest one is the amphitheater. Bryce Point is one of the highest points in the park at 8300 feet. Next, we continued to Paria View. Again, amazing formations mixed with a light snow made this the ultimate experience. We stopped by the Bryce Canyon Lodge which is currently packing everything up for the winter season. It will reopen in April. Not only was the scenery the most beautiful in our opinions, but the week before the lodge closes up is probably the most desolate time to visit the park. You pretty much have the park to yourselves. That doesn't happen during the Spring, Summer, and early Fall (especially May-August). We saw an abundance of Mule deer as well. Our last stop was Fairyland Canyon. This is where that famous scene of a balancing rock above all other formations can be seen in person. We liked everything about our trip to Bryce. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone. It doesn't matter whether you're an outdoor person or not, you absolutely have to see Bryce Canyon National Park!",

To see the other two entrances, plan on driving several hours. The area is an hour drive from Moab but because it isn\u2019t as close to Moab as Arches NP, it sees far less traffic. The park didn\u2019t charge us an entry fee which is nice considering many national parks want to charge $70 per vehicle. The visitor center is smaller than in most other parks but has the same amenities. There are limited facilities available in the north part of the park and no lodging, fuel or restaurants near the park so come prepared. The park has both hiking trails as well as 4WD trails of various degrees of difficulty which should appeal to most people. There are some wonderful views of the canyons in the valley below which are must see. The northern entrance is near Dead Horse State Park which I would recommend visiting at the same time as Island in the Sky. Depending on the amount of hiking or 4WD you plan on doing, 1/2 day is adequate for Island in the Sky. The park is appropriate for people of all ages and abilities.",

As a 12 year old, I was totally mesmorized by this place, which was a national monument then. Almost 5 decades later, Capitol Reef holds the same magic and majesty for me; it remains my favorite park in Utah. Why? It has both tremendous raw beauty with its massive fiery red formations and it has a lovely cultural history with the Mormon lives spent there and the beautiful orchards they left behind still tended by the NPS. During our September visit we enjoyed the 1.8 mile round trip hike to Hickman Natural Bridge and also took the capitol gorge gravel road to its end and hiked the easy, level mile Capitol Gorge Trail to see an amazing petroglyph panel and a pioneer register with several hundred historic signatures. The campground was full all 3 days so we stayed at an RV park in Torrey where having a reservation is a good idea. We enjoyed picking apples and pears for $1.00/lb, with a scale, picking equipment and self pay station offered by the NPS. We took an AWESOME ride around the park, on the Burr Trail, starting in Torrey on Highway 12 and then turning onto Burr Trail at Boulder. We had great coffee and dessert at an eclectic coffee and gift shop in Boulder. The road winds through Grand Staircase Escalante Natl Monument for a time, providing spectacular views. The last part of the road, after the steep switchbacks, was very washboard-ey even in our Jeep. With a car though, you could easily go up to the switchbacks and turn around because the gravel is good from Boulder to the switchbacks. Don't miss Capitol Reef when in Utah. For us, it beats all the other Utah parks in scenery, cultural history and hiking opportunities.",

The geological history that is evident on the rock formations is fascinating as well as beautiful. The historical elements of the pioneers and fruit orchards are also interesting. Definitely recommend spending time in Fruita to pick from the orchards if one of their fruits is in season. We went during apricot season and were astounded by the numbers of apricots on the trees. Visitors may eat as many fresh, organic fruits from the trees as they like. The park even provides fruit pickers for visitors to use for hard-to-reach fruit.

It's beautiful with amazing landscape you expect to see in Utah with lots of hiking options. Beyond that, there's lots more amazing landscapes and things to see around there, in that part of Utah, that are within a semi-short drive away....like Goblin Valley and Robbers Roost. The biggest surprise was that the visitor center and part of the park is set in the Fruita Historic District. There are historic buildings and fruit orchards to pick your own apples, pears and peaches (we didn't see peaches but I think they have those). The fruit is delicious! Whatever you eat in the orchard is free and any you take out is only $1.25 per pound. There's a beautiful park that's perfect for hanging out or for a picnic. The Gifford House is a tiny historic house that's now a museum and store. They sell lots of yummy, locally made jams, jellies and more. And, they sell fresh baked pies and Scottish scones. Go early as they can sell out! They're delicious! You'll see deer roaming through the park all the time and even some wild turkeys. The campground is first come/first serve, only $10 per night and very nice. The visitor center is small but nice. We attended one of the nighttime sky talks conducted by a visiting astronomer with a telescope. It was fascinating and we learned so much! We loved visiting this park and plan to go back. Peaceful, beautiful, amazing! A side note....if you're staying a while....bring all the food you'll need as grocery options are very slim in the town of Torrey. Restaurant choices are slim too...and expensive! You will, however, have no problem finding gas. Torrey is a VERY small town.",

Rt. 12 goes right through the northern section of this park; there really is no \u201centrance.\u201d or \u201cexit.\u201d Arriving at 3PM, we spent time at the Visitors\u2019 Center (be sure to see the film \u201cWatermark\u201d) , headed back to Torrey for a bite of dinner, then headed back to Panorama Point (right off Rt. 12) to watch sundown. The skies were threatening, with rain afar, and we got some awesome pictures of rainbows. The next day we visited Frutia, a restored Mormon settlement, very near Rt. 12. Get there early to have a selection of the homemade pie. You can pick apples, on the honor-system for payment, in the orchards that are still maintained there. There is also a hike that starts there, following the Fremont River. Frutia gives you a feeling of peace; it\u2019s very peaceful there. A short distance east of Frutia on Rt. 12 we visited the petroglyphs and the School House. We got lucky and joined a Ranger-led group and saw petroglyphs we otherwise may have missed. The Scenic Drive is a 16-mile round trip drive that goes south from Frutia and it is breathtakingly beautiful! The second night we returned to Panorama Point (we were the only ones left at nightfall, a bit spooky) to view the stars. Capitol Reef has some of the best naturally dark night sky viewing of the western national parks. It was a clear night and the stars and the Milky Way in the dark night sky were amazing! You could also just use some of the turnoffs off Rt. 12 for this night sky viewing.",

We had incredibly good luck in that we arrived on the first sunny, rain-free day they'd had in a long time. Besides the amazing rock formations and long, beautiful vistas, there is the opportunity to pick fruit at Fruita (apples and pears in mid--September), free to eat there or $1/lb to take with you. We also hiked along the river and then as far up the side of a cliff as we felt comfortable. The day was warm, but as we gained elevation, there was a strong, cool breeze. There were a few other people hiking, and a fair amount of traffic along the scenic route, but it never seemed crowded, and you could tell from the way the other travelers were soaking in the beauty that they were as charmed by this park as we were. We also stopped to see the petroglyphs, and drove far enough along the drive past Capitol Dome to see a tiny historic cabin. If you want a great overlook for an amazing view of this area, there are some not to be missed along Utah Highway 12. We arrived in the area via this road after dark, but backtracked to see the overlooks after exploring Capitol Reef. Definitely worth the twenty-minute back track, which was much faster when not dodging cows on the road in the dark! Reading some of the other reviews, there were enough things we missed that I would definitely return to this park again, and hope for another stroke of luck weather wise!",

        "text": "While the key attraction at Capitol Reef and the reason this area was set aside as a national park is the beautiful geology, this park also offers many other reasons to visit including Fremont Indian petroglyphs, pioneer history, preserved remains of a Mormon frontier town with pick-your-own orchards, Wild-West history, such as a Butch Cassidy hideout, and backcountry adventures. Much of this is accessible along Rt 24 at no cost but even the scenic drive and access to some of the better hikes is only $5. Capitol Reef is named for geology; Capitol for the sandstone domes that look like a capitol dome and Reef for the fold in the Earth known as a monocline, named the Waterpocket Fold, which was a barrier to travel like a reef at sea. The Waterpocket Fold got its name for the pockets eroded in the monocline fold that hold water year round. Highlights of the visit for us were the scenic drive and the Notom-Bullfrog road which provided different perspectives of the Waterpocket Fold; our two favorite hikes, the Cassidy Arch trail and Capitol Gorge trail; the remains of Fruita with the flowering orchards during our spring visit and the Gifford Homestead with the wonderful homemade fruit pies; and, for the kids, the Junior Geology badge. If one has a high clearance 4x4 vehicle, one can visit the backcountry Cathedral Valley section with its famous monoliths and true solitude. This often overlooked national park is very worthwhile for visits of half a day to several days depending upon one\u2019s time and interests.",

The \"Waterpocket Fold\" defines the landscape with it's bulging uplifts, rainbow-hued sandstone reefs and canyons. Entrance to the park is free. There is a visitor's center which is open 8-4:30 and has geology, natural science abd cultural displays. A short orientation video is also given. As with all National Parks, Rangers will assist you in planning an itinerary for the duration of your stay. The highlights of Capitol Reef are the Fremont petroglyphs, the Mormon Homestead, the school house, blacksmith shop, Ripple Rock Nature Center. the Fruita (orchard) and the 16 mile Scenic Drive and backcountry. There are two dirt roads off the Scenic Drive which take you to Cathedral Valley where you walk between vertical cliffs. The Scenic Drive ends in a loop where you turn-around and head back to the visitor's center. The Scenic Drive costs $15 dollars but is free with a Senior Lifetime Pass or other National Park Pass. The Fruita grows apple, peach, cherry, pear, and apricots. Pies and other baked goods are available during the harvest season. Eat what you like for free. If you want to pick and take home there is a minimal fee. They have historic and heirloom varieties. Off of Scenic Highway 24 westbound and about a 1/2 mile from the visitor's center you will find the old school house and Fremont (700 AD-1250 AD) petroglyphs. Capitol Reef and the Hickman Bridge are just down the road on Highway 24. I wish I was there for the fruit harvest. I would have given the park a 5 star rating.",

        "text": "I have to admit that we had never heard of Capitol Reef until we decided to spend a month exploring SW Utah. Although all of the Utah national parks relate to the geology of the Colorado Plateau, each one has been preserved because it is different. Capitol Reef is newer (1971) than its national park siblings in the state and, by comparison, suffers from the fact that it is huge and doesn't have as many well marked vistas that you can drive to and take a picture at. Not that it doesn't have absolutely stunning views, but they aren't the great amphitheaters of Bryce or the temples of Zion. The majesty of Capitol Reef is the fact that it is literally a hundred miles long! Some tour guides mention that it is better appreciated from the air than at ground level. Although many people probably just stop at the visitor center and then continue across the park on Route 24, you won't appreciate the geology nearly as much unless you drive on at least a portion of the scenic drive. It's only from the drive that you can truly see the extent of the cliffs that are the primary feature of the park. If time is limited you don't have to drive the entire distance; it's only a $5 fee so it's not a big expense even for a shorter drive. When you do drive across on Rt24 be sure to stop at the petroglyphs; they are the easiest to get to ones we've found anywhere in the SW.",

We got there early, around 9:30am, paid $4 per person at the entrance. If you have the National Parks Pass, you can get in for free. There were about 5 overlooks that you can drive your car to. Higher elevation so it was a bit cooler (high 50's-low 60's). It was great coz no one was there so photo ops was perfect. Stopping at the five overlooks gives you different perspective of the views. It was spectacular & we were glad to have stopped. I think there was a hiking trail right at the entrance. ",

At 10,000 feet, the cool air was a refeshing change from the heat of the other parks.

I am 62, very overweight, have a recently sprained ankle, and a knee with osteoarthritis. However, I was able, with plenty of water and my walking stick, to hike up and around most of the sites in the park. My husband is very fit, so after I got tired, I had him hike in alone to one of the sites while I chilled in the car. I recommend going in cool weather. Pay attention to the road conditions, and plan enough time for travel in and out of the park. If it has been raining or snowing, I would call the park HQ for information about road conditions. Here was our experience driving into the location in a Honda Pilot SUV, about two days after rain: about 12 minutes of paved road; followed by 18 minutes of rough, corrugated surface; followed by 24 minutes of terrible road with many ruts and potholes, and a few places where we had to get on the other side of the road because our side was washed out. Reverse that for the way out. One of the rangers told me that he drives the road in a Honda Fit! (He doesn't leave that often, but still...) For a sixty-something couple who both love Ancient Puebloan ruins (also see Mesa Verde and Canyon de Chelly if you have similar interests), this was a worthwhile side trip, and I wish we'd had a day or more to devote to this site. It might be hard for a young family to handle the jarring time in and out, and the lack of colorful things for the kids to see. Also, I know my preschool grandsons would be eager to climb on the ruins, which is the only attraction here, but which is not allowed in order to preserve the ruins.",

Be aware this location is out in the middle of nowhere so plan accordingly. There is a small visitor center, but no place close by to purchase food or water. The entrance fee is $16.00 per vehicle. Hiking trails are everywhere and the pristine canyon itself, with all the original settlements scattered about, is truly breathtaking and is awe inspiring. All of the settlements are archaeological treasures and most are still being uncovered. The night sky in this part of the state is crystal clear and is a bonus for astronomy buffs and other star gazers. Be aware the last 12 miles into the park is over rutted gravel covered dirt roads, and the last 3 miles or so are extremely rough and rutty consisting of dirt with an average safe speed of 15 mph or less.

We got a few miles down it and hit a super rough portion and decided to turn around even though we were driving a rental. I told my wife that had it been my own car I would turn back--so we did. We got about a half mile back towards the highway when a local guy came cruising by in his pickup. I asked him about the road and he said it was another 10 miles to reach the park and the paved road- but that he sees people in rentals driving in all the time--we were in a Nissan Sentra. So upon hearing that we said let's just go for it-so we turned around again and found some grooves in the road and arrived. We had stopped in Aztec earlier in the day so by the time we arrived it was 4:45--a bit late no doubt. With dark clouds rapidly approaching and knowing of the low lying flood plains in several spots along the road we did a quick tour of the main ruins. It was spectacular and well worth the drive. Wish we had arrived earlier or could have stayed longer but those dark clouds had us a bit nervous--for good reason as it turned out. As we were driving the rain arrived at first a few sprinkles but steadily it increased until we were in a pretty good downpour--not quite a monsoon though. The road became super slick and now the reason for the washboarding of the road became our best friend as it provided traction in the ever increasing slipperiness of the road. There is a very fine clay-like soil covering the road and in the rain it becomes a slip-like substance making for nerve wracking driving. There were a couple of spots where traction became an issue but from having driven in snow many times I knew the main thing was to keep moving--if you stop you get stuck. There was one small hill we almost didn't make and I think had we been 10 minutes later we would have gotten stuck. I figured someone would come by sooner or later and for a few dollars would give a tow but who want to so through that? Anyways the bottom line is definitely go; leave early in the day to give yourself plenty of time to explore and then leave about 4 to avoid the late afternoon summer storm. Conversely you can camp at Chaco overnight which we considered. Depending on the direction you're heading--we were headed to Arizonz--you can take a \"shortcut\" dirt road to get you closer to US 40 but in our situation we deemed that unadvisable since we'd already done the 12 mile dirt road and barely made it. If you do end up going out the way you came as we did--book a room in Farmington not Gallup as we did--it was another 3 or 4 hours after getting back on the 550.

        "text": "Chaco Canyon has been on my bucket list for a very long time. We finally made the day trip out there from Albuquerque - about 3 hours one way. Best to go I-25 north to US 550 northwest, and then south on CR 7900 (just like they suggest). BUT . . . that dirt road at the end was brutal. I called in advance just to check if my Toyota Sienna minivan could make the trip. The woman who answered at the Visitor's Center told me she makes the trip in her Nissan Sentra. So we gave it a go. I would NOT do that again in our vehicle. I would make sure you go in a 4x4 or in something with superior suspension/shocks. The grading on the dirt road (the final 13 miles before entering the park) is so awful that it nearly rattled the teeth out of my skull. At times I could only go 5MPH because of the continuous, tiny bumps. I'm not exaggerating. The bumpiness was so bad that it rattled the DVD right off the ceiling of our car! So . . . getting past that, Chaco Culture Park is simply amazing. If you're into history, architecture, ancient culture, etc. then you MUST see Chaco Culture. $8 park entrance fee for one vehicle, good for a week. We brought our 3 very young kids and they had a blast. It's mostly safe for them to run around, especially within the maze-like complex itself. But keep an eye on the little ones because there are some spots where they could have a serious fall if they take the wrong step. I guess that advice is true for adults, too. I didn't realize it until after, but this could make for a fun overnight camping trip, too. Check with the visitor center for availability and price, but there are several camping spots available. You park inside the park and pitch your tent right there. There are toilets and running water, but nothing else. So be prepared to pack in your own food. To sum it up, Chaco Culture National Historic Park is amazing and we are so glad we finally made it.",

We ask a ranger about the south route/road conditions into Chaco Canyon. He said the road (57/14) had just been graded so it should be in good condition. Not so. The dirt road was very wash board and had thick sand in many places. The 19 miles of dirt road took about 90 minutes in my 4x4 truck. Once there, the park was awesome. We saw six of the main ruins in 6 hours and they were all close (1/2 mile or less) from the parking lots. The six main ruins are Una Vida (ruins and petroglyphs), Hungo Pavi (ruins), Cheltro Keti (has the largest Kiva I have ever seen, ruins and petroglyphs), Pueblo Bonito (very large ruins), Pueblo del Arroyo (ruins) and Casa Rinconada (ruins). My husband and I have toured many Indian ruins across a few states and I have to say these are the best. The weather was perfect (about 75 degrees) the last weekend in May.Cost $8 per vehicle.",

        "text": "This is a national park that has some of the best historical sites and ruins in the USA. We did it in a day trip out of Albuquerque, so we left at 6 a.m. and were there before 10 a.m. It is a beautiful drive, and if you get going early, you can easily spend 6 hours at the park exploring the sites and be back in Albuquerque by sunset. It was a wonderful day of sight seeing, and the ruins are truly stunning. There are examples of different brick patterns, and the circular buildings are amazing. There are picnic tables nearby, where you can enjoy a lunch (bring your own food and beverages), and there are bathroom facilities. The interior park is paved, but there is a 10 to 15 mile stretch of unpaved road you have to drive, so an SUV, or higher off the ground vehicle, is the preferred means of transport. You can maneuver it in a car, but you will have to drive very slow to dodge all the ruts.....and you can't dodge them completely. It does feel like you are driving on a washboard. But do not let that stop you from going, as that part of the trip is very short compared to the payoff when you see the sites. There are many trails, and if you stay longer, you can hike to the top and get a cliff view of the ruins. We saw lots of lizards and birds. It is very remote, so do not plan on cell phone reception. I also recommend taking pleny of sunscreen, as even when it is cool, the sun is closer and burning down. We went in Spring, and I can't image going at the height of the summer as I bet the temperatures get extremely hot. The winds can also be strong, so if you can, it is best to go on a nice day, especially since the unpaved road section can be problematic with rain, etc. Chaco Canyon is totally worth the trek, and it is one of the few places in the USA where you can find important ruins from over 1000 years ago. It cost $8 per car for our visit and was quite the bargain!",

It was magic then and even more magical now as we were able to indulge only our own interest. Because it's such a long trip in off the main road, I couldn't imagine not extending our stay by camping in the canyon which we did for two nights. I know lots of people do an in and out in one day but there's so much more to see and learn than that kind of schedule permits. The walking tours from the Visitor Center are a terrific way to get acclimated. Then you can take off on your own, stepping out of time to be with those who came before. The architecture, for me, was the compelling element and a two dollar poster we picked up at the Visitor Center now reminds us of the mystery every time we go up and down our stairs.",

I was not disappointed. Pueblo Bonito, as well as two similar sites located nearby, are a fascinating \"must-see\" for anyone interested in Pre-Columbian Native American culture. Unfortunately, 16 miles of the 21-mile long county road on which one must travel to reach the site is unpaved and very jarring due to the road's washboard effect! Make sure your car is up to it before you head out. Thankfully, the road inside the park is paved and all the major sites, including Pueblo Bonito, are located only a short walk from a parking lot! The Park Service staff, who are presently housed in a temporary yurt-like structure while a permanent visitors center is being built, were very helpful and there were plenty of interesting books and other items for sale. I advise reading up on Ancestral Pueblo culture before arriving however, in order to better understand and get the most out of your visit.",

We wanted to get a stamp in our National Parks Passport book but I just had to visit the place that Johnny Horton's song was all about. I was raised on that song and know all of the words. It is located not far from New Orleans and appears to be a place that not many know about. It was mostly empty the day we visited. It has a very small visitor center and is mostly just open fields that were the battlegrounds. The final battle of the War of 1812 was fought on this property. There is a Creole style house on the property but I don't remember the history of it. It was privately owned. You can drive around the perimeter of the battlefields and there is an audio tour you can do on your cellphone. Next to the battlefields is a National Cemetery where 4 graves are from War of 1812 soldiers, a section for African-Americans, and many from the Civil War. Overall, visiting this Historical Park was laid back and quiet allowing for imagining the battle that truly ended the Revolutionary War and the final defeat of the British.",

Outdoors there are lots of walking paths (accessible and level with places to sit) throughout the entire area with a stage for special events, picnic tables and restrooms, the actual historic boundary and monument, a courtyard with a fountain and gardens, and landscaping showcasing native vegetation of the Chihuahuan Desert. As beautiful and interesting as the grounds were, it was the Cultural Center that was the highlight for me. As you approach the complex you will see the colorful 18' x 120' \"Our Heritage\" outdoor mural by Carlos Flores (part of a series of murals in El Paso) recognizing the differences and similarities between cultures. Once inside there are a short introductory film and exhibits explaining in detail how the \"Chamizal Problem\" which started during the presidency of Lincoln and was resolved in 1963 was peacefully settled. It was the exhibit \"Costumes of Mexico\", a collection of 32 dolls (one from each state in Mexico) and the free Companion Guide (in both English and Spanish) that was of greatest interest to me. The guide explained in detail the history, culture, and interesting information on each state. Until August 31, 2017 there is a special photography exhibit \"Photo Walk El Paso\" in the Franklin G Smith Gallery next door to the Cultural Center. It is a part of a Global Photo Walk taking place simultaneously around the world and features photos of El Paso and the Chichuahuan Desert. ",

You'd never know it was there, hidden behind a residential area off the highway you'd usually have no need to go that far on, unless heading into Mexico. After we found our way through the road construction, we drove back to the main parking area and were greeted by a quiet, peaceful place. The grounds are a good size, with nice walking paths. They don't really go anywhere in particular - just a few crisscrossing loops. A few picnic areas are available. You can see across the border and watch traffic next door going across one of the main bridges into Mexico. Inside, there is a nice display of the historical meaning of the memorial. I had no idea the history behind it and found it quite interesting that this conflict over the land lasted for so long. Like many national parks, some of the displays are in dire need of an overhaul. Many of the \"interactive\" displays were broken. The videos are quite old and getting fuzzy. But the information and knowledge is great. There was one older gentleman working there that was so friendly and excited to see us. (There was only one other couple there, in addition to our group of 5.) He asked where we were from, offered a sticker to my son and even helped us out in the gift shop before we left as well. You can tell he loves his job and is proud of the memorial.",

They do not allow \"outside\" firewood, so it is on sale from the hosts at $6/bundle. There was also a sign that indicated $6 for the dump service; possibly this is waived if you are a registered camper? It was a very nice one-night stopover for us.",

As a local who is always on the lookout for great rock walls to climb, I'm gonna let you in on a little known secret place around here! Less than a mile north from the Northern Arizona Museum, on 180, there is a road on your right, called \"Shultz Pass\". Turn right on it. Go straight at the fork. The road is now dirt, but maintained. Go past a metal gate (which closes this road off in the winter). As you travel a couple miles down the road, start looking to your right for the mountain face to be close to the road. There are 2 primitive parking areas there, and not 500 feet off from the parking, is a massive rock wall, complete with some caves, and very private! So make sure to bring all of your gear, some food and plan to make a day of it! This wall is kid friendly as well, maybe not for seniors!! There is a level you can climb up that is a path, that you don't need gear for. Any higher, you need the gear. There is no cost to visit this area!",

It was a cool rainy day and we couldn't think of a lot of options on how to spend it. They have a \"ranger program\" a few times during the day and we were hoping the rain would let up so we could go to it - it is normally held outdoors. Shortly before it was scheduled (2pm) it really started to pour. They were discussing whether to try to do it inside, cancel it due to the weather, or just go for it. I was hoping for option 1 but they chose 3. The ranger was in full rain gear. I had a light weight gortex jacket with a hood and my husband just had a jacket. We had an umbrella in the car. We didn't think we needed it just to run into the visitors' center. My husband ran out and got it and went, with a few other brave/foolish souls, outside to hear the full description of of the battle that took place there. Like I said, we were there before and I heard it then and didn't want to get wet to stand out in the rain to hear it again. My husband came back about 20 minutes later wet but happy that he'd gone. While he was out I looked through the items in the gift shop and discovered that they had a CD for sale for $5.25 including tax that was a Yorktown auto tour. We decided to buy it - a perfect activity for a rainy day, we thought. It took about an hour and was very interesting. I would highly recommend it. If you're \"into\" history this is a great stop. I'm not sure how interesting it would be for small children. Since this is a national park there is an entrance fee.",

A ranger took us on a walking tour outside in the vicinity of the center. She was a very knowledgeable young women. I learned about General Cornwallis, and that the battle of Yorktown was the last decisive battle of the American Revolution in 1781. We were on the actual battlefield along the banks of the York River. It is a beautiful country setting. One would not believe a war was raging here at that time. After the walk, we toured the museum at the center and explored a replica of a ship from that era. We then did our own self guided driving tour through the battlefields of Yorktown. The beauty and serenity of this place is enough to make it worth the visit. We saw numerous people jogging the country paths and back roads of this battlefield.

They offer a very informative video. The hours are very limited in that the Visitor Center closes at 4:00 PM. I would recommend driving up to the top of Montezuma Pass. The last two miles of the natural surface road demand low speed and total concentration on the many twists and turns. Once you reach the summit, there are restrooms and picnic tables. You will also find great views and an opportunity to talk Border Control with the Border Control Agents that have high-tech detection equipment set up at the top of the pass. Elsewhere, the park does have hiking trails best utilized early in the day.",

The loop which circles the park was closed for one direction of traffic at a time as September is the time of year they do their road maintenance. The wait time for traffic in one direction was about a half hour severely cutting into our time to visit the park. When we finally arrived at the park visitor center we were told that we couldn't get to the trail to go down into the crater except by bus and the bus was leaving within minutes. The bus fee was exorbitant, but we decided to take it so we could make it to the trail. As it turns out, you can actually make it to the trail via a relatively short hike along the road from a parking place up the road from the trail. The parking for the trail we wanted to take was closed due to the fact that it was being used for construction vehicles - poor planning on the park's part to close a parking area for a popular hiking spot. If we had known we could have hiked the short distance from the next parking area over and saved ourselves a couple hundred dollars. Also, because we had to take the bus, we were stopped by the same construction that had stopped us on the way into the park - another half hour delay. Most of the day at Crater Lake was spent just stopping in traffic. This was my worst experience of poor management at a national park.",

Next we asked....\"can we go around to the rim village on the east as it looks like the west rim road has a closure?\" His retort was...\" yes but it's a long drive.\" This gentleman was obviously totally burnt out and is absolutely the wrong person to be greeting people at the entrance station.

We stopped at several of the road side parking lots around the rim and enjoyed beautiful views of the lake and surrounding area. After lunch, the park became a mad house. The parking lots filled up and people were parking in the road, making the road a one lane. Vehicles were fighting for right of way. We even saw a couple different groups of people getting into a fight over parking at the lodge.

It's $15.00 per vehicle unless you are super invested & have a national park pass.

Tour takes roughly 2 hours, and of course you can drive back to any place in the park to see more or do a little hiking.

I recommend reading up on other comments/advice! We drove up from Ashland in the South. You will lose phone service which can be a little unnerving if you don't know where you are and if you're not certain that you are going the right way. I think it would have been helpful if there had been a few more signs along the way since you drive many miles in (beautiful) forest before you get to the lake. We arrived at the entrance at 8:30 am and there were very few people there. Entrance fee was $15. The lake was stunning and made me think of so many questions about it's formation and water content. There were many stops along the way and we took advantage of most of them. In my research, I didn't find any hiking trails that stood out and there were cautions that trails might not be available d/t snow. However I found interesting reviews on Toketee Falls which was about 30 miles north of the park on highway 138. We decided to hike to those falls. After a fun hike, we drove back down to CLNP and did the other half of the route. By now there was quite a line to get into the park. Luckily we were able to swing into the outside lane as that booth was for reentry! By the way, there was no phone service to Toketee Falls either. We pulled up at Rim Village for a late lunch but the parking lot was nuts. We decided to skip it and headed down to the Annie Creek Restaurant. It was much less crowded there and we put our name on the list to be seated. It didn't take us long to figure out that service at this place was super slow and it would take us a very long time to get our meal. We decided to check out the Mazama General Store that was located across the parking lot. I noticed that they had sandwiches there so we decided to grab one to go and skip Annie's. This was at 2 pm. I suspect we made a good choice. We were very glad we arrived at the park as early as we did as it was pretty full by the time we left. Other than Beckie's Cafe on hwy 62 and the Rogue River Viewpoint, there didn't seem to be much between CLNP and Ashland other than driving through beautiful forest. And that was just fine!",

It's not even that pricey at about $200 a night considering the location). The reason to stay there is not just to have more time during the day at the lake, but to see the night sky covered with a gazillion blinking stars. Be sure to hike the Cleetwood Cove Trail down to the boat dock - whether or not you are taking the boat ride.

OK, couldn't get to the lodge so we decided to try the nearby \"cafe\"...which was just a bad joke. It's actually a lightly stocked self-serve place with fewer choices then your average convenience store (I mean that literally!). There is no menu and you can't order anything...you just pick up your $11 cold sandwich choice from a cooler and pay for it...which we did. For a cold case sandwich it was fine, but Subway would have been better.",

We entered the park at the North entrance and exited the South Entrance, which brought us straight to Canyonville, as opposed to through Roseburg, as going to the North Entrance does. We heard about Crater Lake from one of the other guests who visited on Saturday June 3rd so we decided to visit. The drive up is beautiful itself, a two laned highway that follows the Umpqua River, have your camera's fully charged as the view of the rapids are breath taking. Getting to the gate, when the ranger shack is closed, payment is by envelope and drop box. From there it's a nine-mile drive to the lake. I do not have the vocabulary to describe adequately to beauty that is Crater Lake, the caldera is awesome, the views are amazing, and the water is the bluest blue I have ever seen, and that is just at the first view point. There are many others as you follow the contour of the lake on the Crater Lake Highway. There are also many campsites in the park along the highway and I'm good fishing in the river. Next trip we plan on finding the perfect spot to set up camp next to the river. We would have circumnavigated the entire lake, but the Eastern road is still on winter closure, oh yeah, I forgot to mention, plenty of snow in June even though it was 70 degrees outside. So if you like amazing views, a great place to camp, fish, or hike, check out Crater Lake National Park.",

It is one of the most well kept secret places to visit that compares with Yellowstone and the Grand Canyon. This phenomenal crater is well worth the drive and the volcanic collapse that created this \"crater\" became the deepest lake in the United States (over 1900 feet deep) and the cleanest lake (clarity) in the WORLD! The 33 mile drive around the lake is amazing. We took the park ranger guided trolley tour for $27 each and was well worth it. It was a 2 hour journey that took us to multiple stops around the 'crater' as well as much information about how it was formed, who helped preserve it, and the numerous facts about it. We sure are glad that this country had some very intelligent people that helped persevere at getting places like this protected by our government in the early 1900's. Glad this place, like so many of our other National Parks were preserved for the generations in the future to enjoy. I've been to all US states except 2 and I can personally say visiting this was as enjoyable as some of the other desired National Parks to visit. Don't miss this one!!!",

I read other reviews on TripAdvisor to get an idea of what to expect, and this sixth oldest national park in the U.S. met all of my expectations and more! We drove through the North Entrance to the park from Highway 97, and after paying the $10.00 entrance fee (for a family car) we were amazed, after a few miles of driving, with the rather stunning vista that awaited us. That first view that you see of the lake is just awesome!!! Your jaw will drop when you see the six-mile wide caldera filled with the most stunningly beautiful blue water in the world that you'll ever see! We stayed at the Mazama Village Cabins (much preferred over the lodge, which is more expensive and a bit crowded) and drove the Rim Drive to go from one look-out point to another. Parts of the Rim Drive were inaccessible due to highway construction, so those areas had to be traveled after 4 or 5 pm when the construction crews left their work for the day. When you go make sure you can take one of the three boat tours that the National Park Service offers on the lake. My family and I took the standard boat tour for $37.00 per adult, and it is well worth the price. You have to get to the boat hiking down Cleetwood trail which is easy enough going down (takes about 30 or so minutes), but can be a rather strenuous hike back up to the Rim Drive, taking up to an hour or more to return to the parking lot. There is no TV or phone service to speak of on top of the mountain, although there is wi-fi but that is sketchy and limited to those who are guests of the lodge and cabins. Oh, there are no pets (dogs) allowed on the national park service trails, and no dogs allowed on the boat tours, so for those who are pet owners be advised that if you do bring your animals on the trails you will be asked by park service staff to take them away and shelter them elsewhere.

It was pretty steep, but worth it. there were kids and families hiking as well. We stopped at the bowl and the lake was breathtaking! The remainder of the hike was snow covered and since we spent the day before in Mount Rainier doing snow hikes, we opted to stop here. We then returned to our car and drove to Cleetwood cove where we hiked down to the lake. This was an EXTREMELY steep hike. On the way down, we passed a man heading up. He was leaning against a tree and told us, \"Be glad you're not fat\". We kind of laughed it off. We got to the water and it was amazing.

Take an auto tour around the rim of the lake, stop at various scenic point (each view is different from the rest), attempt panoramic pictures (only to be frustrated, what you see can't be captured). By now, you are clearly drawn to the lake and its allure, still your rational mind makes you think its a lake, no big deal. Consider this...the lake has neither inlets nor outlets, all the water is filled by precipitation and snowfalls, melts. This makes it one of the most purest, freshest and palatable waters in the whole world, simply scoop and drink. If all of this still doesn't convince you, camp out at the Mazama Campground, ponder this over and head to a conducted boat tour early next morning. Tickets are first come first serve, so suggest being there at 7, I think the tour was at 830. There is a steep 1 mile hike down to the lake, fun begins when you finish the tour :) The trip also has an optional stop and hike at Mount Washington, its a small island in the lake. The views from the top of it are out of the ordinary and not every passing tourist gets to experience it, the hike intensity is moderate and would be worth every ounce of energy you spend. ",

So glad we did because the line in the rim village cafe (only place to get food in park) was out the door. And it didn't look all that good. Our big disappointment was that the East Rim Drive was closed about 2 miles in, so the Rim Loop couldn't be completed. This was just last week so I would check in advance before heading out to make sure it's open. Just not as much fun when you can't do the loop. The lake itself is spectacular, though, and the color is more beautiful than any lake I have ever seen. It's obvious they have a lot of rock slides along the sides and perhaps this is why the road is closed? Either that or snow, yes, there was still snow around the lake. Definitely worth the visit and an easy trip from Portland or Eugene. Cost to get into the park is a very reasonable $10 per car and lots of good hiking options if you want to spend more time there.

We drove a couple of hours from Eugene to see it and it was well worth it, just be sure you have plenty of gas! We left the interstate at Roseburg and drove hwy 138 through the mountains. Its a gorgeous drive along the river but there are no gas stations or restaurants etc along the way! If hou are a hiker there are many many trails along the way and in the park. If you do nothing in the park but drive up and around the rim you will need about 3 hours, however you could spend an entire day easily! This is a DO NOT MISS Oregon attraction! We made many stops along the way to the park along hwy 138 as well, and then drove back through Bend And Sisters Oregon. This route allows you to see more of the Cascade Mountain Range and the Lava Fields if you want to (unfortunately we did not have time to stop by them). Stopped for dinner in Bend at the Riverhouse on US 97. Beautiful dining overlooking the river and food was great. This entire round trip from Eugene took about 12 hours and we could have used much more time!!

The video at the visitors center was very impressive and informative. After viewing the newly made video, gathering info in the visitors center, and having our questions answered by helpful rangers, we knew exactly what we wanted to do and see at Crater Lake. The boat tours were all booked early on our first day so we took the trolley ride around the rim road, explored Rim Village and hiked the Castle Crest nature trail. We booked an early boat tour for our second day. That boat tour was well worth the wait and is best way to experience Crater Lake National Park! The ranger interpreters gave excellent talks during the boat ride. Wizard Island was a real surprise. The hike out of the crater is real exercise, but there are many resting benches. All facilities were very clean. I lost my National Park Passport while in the park. It was returned to me by mail from the Crater Lake Natural History Association. Thank you very much!",

This is a rural, national park, with great effort to keep it as pristine as possible. Appropriately, it is two hours from the nearest freeway. Views are fantastic and the rim drive is a good example of Civilian Conservation Corps construction from the 1930's. Spend some time to explore the park. There is a new, free and good video at the visitor center near park headquarters. There are lots of hiking opportunities, including one to the lake for guided boat tours (Advance reservations are required.) The facilities are classic and include the lodge with a spectacular view. The Lodge restaurant is expensive, $20-30 per person. The rim Cafe is $5-10 for very simple fare and prepackaged food. At Mazama village, 7 miles from the rim, there is a campground, restaurant ($10-15 per plate), cabin motor inn, small general store and gas station. If you can, attend a ranger talk at the campground amphitheater This is higher elevation 5-7,000 feet and the snow remains through July. So, take appropriate clothing; e.g. jacket for cool evenings in August. The lake can be clouded in often from fall through late spring. Often the \"fog\" doesn't burn off til mid afternoon.

Beautiful views of the lake from several places along the circle rim drive, but the best are from the walkway at the rim village. Lots of events on the weekend.

        "text": "Crater Lake National Park is THE National Park in Oregon. You can stay and relax at the lodge for an amazing experience if you book well in advance, or you can camp in the park. (We camped.) But don't be afraid to just make it a day trip. It is definitely possible as a day trip from Bend, Grants Pass or the like. Even transiting on I-5, taking a few extra hours out of your route to see the lake is worth it. While the full loop is nice, you can get a lot just by driving the north-south route that borders the lake. Visit the lodge area, and a few turnouts, then be on your way as you need. As well, if you have the time, schedule and take the lake boat tour. It is about 2 hours on a boat, touring around the lake and seeing things you cannot see from the crater wall. The hike to the boat is not easy - 1.1 miles, 700+ feet elevation. Think of climbing the stairs in a 65 story building. But take it slow if you need to. But if you do have the time, there is a lot to be seen on trials and it would be easy to spend several days soaking up the place. Any time the road to the lodge is open, it is worth seeing.",

        "text": "Crater Lake is not just a \"lake.\". It is impossible to describe to anyone who has never been. Just GO, but save your trip to late August or early September, the perfect time is just after Labor Day when kids are back in school if you want less crowds (it will still be crowded.). Most people don't stay here long because it seems there is nothing to \"do\", meaning this is not a lake resort, it is a visual and sensory spectacular event, a place to return to yourself, if you give yourself the time to slow down and discover the area. If you want the best, stay in the Crater Lake Lodge, but you'll need to reserve far in advance to get a lake view room (the only kind worth the $$$, it isn't cheap.). Stay on the top floor in one of the claw foot bathtub rooms. A warning- no TV, nothing but the view. They do have wi-fi now, but if you have an iPhone, no service- Verizon usually works. But the idea is to unplug! Take the hike to the top of the ranger station at Hillman Peak. Drive down to the Pinnacles. Drive the rim drive and stop along the way. Take the boat tour only if you are in good physical condition - the hike back up is very challenging. The same with the boat ride and optional hike up to the top of Wizard Island. For your first time, do it all- the ranger talks, etc. Even if you are not staying at the lodge, wander into the fireplace lounge early and grab a seat by the fireplace or on a sofa. After 3pm they serve drinks and food there, and you can curl up and read for hours. Or weather permitting, go out on the veranda and snap up one of the coveted rockers to view the lake and hang out- again, they will serve you there after 3pm. The lodge staff are from many different countries and many of them are friendly and great stories abound. Dinner or lunch at the lodge is also a treat in the dining room, but call in advance to make reservations for dinner as it is very popular. This need intensifies as the summer months go on. Really, the lake is only in tourable mode between mid-July and mid-September. I was just ther in early June and there was 6 feet of snow and at times you couldn't see the lake, it was snowing so much. Ther are a number of places to stay within 30 minutes, just outside of the lake, but choose carefully, as many places capitalize on the lake as a destination and aren't as they claim.",

In most other lakes, we were told, you usually would see below water surface up to say 100 ft. But, at Crater Lake, you see much, much deeper below surface. The air is also so fresh. Add a sky as backdrop, with some white clouds, hmmmmm. For vacation purposes, there is no place better than some spot in the U.S., esp. the national parks. No place where it's so well-equipped, humanly and naturally, and bargain basement costs (a mere few dollars entrance fee).

We spent 2 days exploring Crater Lake more thoroughly, and still felt like we missed so much. Take the rim drive slowly, stop at all the pull-offs. Each angle is a different view and brings new surprises, even just 25 yards further along the rim. Get out of the car. Soak in the amazing geological history. We took the time to hike down Cleetwood trail and take the 2 hour boat trip around the lake. The climb is not easy, but we are middle aged and took our time. It is well worth it. The views from the lake level give a whole new view of the geology. The US National Park Service Guide was a fountain of knowledge and taught us fascinating things about the Crater and its history. She pointed out many formations and explained their meaning. Next time we will explore some of the trails to wonders surrounding the caldera.

The tour location takes about an hour to reach by NPS van, and once there, it's about a two-hour walking tour through the Hensley farm lands, their service buildings, and one of their homes. The scenery is beautiful, and our ranger-guide, Sharon, did an exceptional job of keeping us informed about the Hensley family and how they survived in this remote location. It gives one great appreciation of the hardships some of the early pioneers endured just to survive. The tour costs $10 ($5 with a Golden Eagle pass), but it was well worth the time and effort.

The park features a 20-mile towpath trail that follows the Ohio and Erie canals which is great for biking or walking. We had brought bikes with us so, after having lunch on the patio of Foster's, a pub in the cute little town, we biked from Peninsula to the Canal Visitor's Center which was about 10-miles. It was a flat, comfortable trail with lots to see along the way including herons and a small furry animal which I couldn't identify. There were two museums that we stopped at along the trail, one in Boston focused on the boats that plied the canal, and the second at the visitor's center explored the canals in general. Both were definitely worth a stop. A passenger train runs along the path and because we were short on time and the timing was right we took it on the way back from the visitor's center to where we parked our cars in Peninsula. It was fun--volunteers are dressed as conductors and they take your fare which is just a couple of dollars--while other staff load your bikes.

If you hike, bike or run the Towpath trail the train for you is only $3! The train ride took a bit over an hour, we relaxed, got a beer on board and really enjoyed the scenery. The east side of the train definitely will have a better view as you follow the water on that side, rather than just views of trees. Just so you know, the regular riders on the train, in all the front cars have really cold air conditioned cars, so if you get hot during the ride like I did, just take a walk to one of those cars as the car in the back for the bikers was hot on our Sept day. ON the Towpath trail itself, we saw bluebird, turtles, heron, beaver damns, even a small snake yikes, and some cute towns that we would have stopped in if we weren't in a hurry to complete our journey as we did not want to miss the train ride back. When boarding the train as a biker, you don't pay your fare until onboard the train, and you get on the train at the corner of the Rockside parking lot nearest to the train tracks, you will see a sign there for \"bike aboard\", so don't sit in the train station with the regular riders. If you want to take a more relaxed route, you might want to ride the train first, then bike back, so you don't have to worry about missing your train. The second day in the park we hiked to the Beaver Marsh (where a National Park employee will explain what you see there) Brandywine Falls, Blue Hen Falls, Oak Hill hiking (which was the only really quiet place we explored, and much enjoyed) and the highlight was the \"Ledges area\", really awesome hike, but many stairs. Everett Road has a nice covered bridge. Riverview Rd was quite busy with traffic on our day, and the parking lots at some stops were almost full so we picked the more popular stops to do first (Ledges). No, this isn't like your typical park out west, but for anyone in the Midwest or East this is surely worth the drive in IF you like to bike, hike or even jog. Would be an excellent marathon training run, and you will see plenty others to inspire you along. We got lucky enough to see a visiting steam engine as well this weekend, train lovers paradise.",

For only $3.00 you can load your bike on the Cuyahoga RR and travel whatever distance you would like and then ride the Towpath Trail back. The bike trail is a combination of gravel and paved asphalt with numerous places to stop and explore. There are key visitors centers at Boston Mills and The Canal Exploration Center. I recommend going to the visitor center first. We also visited Brandywine Falls which is very nice. The whole park is very historic with much to learn about the Ohio and Erie Canal. There was also lots of wildlife, especially birds to look for and enjoy watching. This was was of the nicest biking experiences I have done and highly recommend it to everyone that likes to ride the rails to trails circuit.",

There is an excellent option where bike riders with their bikes can hop the CVSR train for $2 and get dropped off at a distant train stop to ride the trail back to their cars. Interesting history on the Ohio canal. Cool waterfalls. The Farmers Market at Howe Meadow on Saturday morning was the BEST market I visited this year.

If you rent, on the other hand,as we did, then you have to meticulously plan your schedule to catch the train. Otherwise, you can end up paying quite a bit since rentals are $9/hr. There are a couple of quaint little towns here, and we happened to run into an enjoyable farmer's market in Peninsula, OH on a beautiful day. Also, it is really close to Cleveland.

There was construction near the campground which; unfortunately, started about 4:00 a.m. every day. I ended up having to use earplugs in an attempt to reduce the beeping and slamming of the heavy equipment. We had reserved tickets for the Kantishna tour a couple of weeks prior to our arrival but we noticed there was still availability the day prior. Maybe it was a slower part of the tourist season. The tour took us to the end of the park road. Round trip was about 12 hours. We rode in a bus similar to school buses, we were comfortable enough. There were several stops for restroom breaks. We saw several grizzlies, caribou and Dall sheep, most were at a considerable distance so I would suggest binoculars. The driver was knowlegable and gave the group plenty of time to take pictures of wildlife. Overall, we were pleased with the tour. We also took a ranger guided hike from the visitor center to the sled dog demonstration which we really enjoyed. It was leisurely paced, about 2.5 miles in length. Much of it was up hill and I considered it moderately strenuous at times. The ranger was very friendly and seemed to enjoy answering our questions and sharing her knowledge.

I had read that the farther yo go on the road inside Denali, the better your chances of seeing wildlife. So I opted for the $60.00 upgrade to the Tundra Wilderness Tour. It was well worth it! We saw a bunch of caribou, a moose and a new born baby, several Dall sheep, a porcupine, several Ptarmigan and the coup de grais a momma grizzly with her 2 baby grizzly cubs! It was why we're were there and exactly what I was hoping for! They do provide a box \"lunch\"- cheese, crackers, applesauce and some bottled water. The tour goes out to Mile 53 (currently-will go out to about mile 90 later in the summer) so the tour can last anywhere from 7 to 9 hours. I would bring something more to eat next time. Oh and the naturalist/bus driver was very knowledgeable and did a great job!",

The inside passage included so many great sites, Ketchikan, Juneau, Skagway, and Whittier. Glacier Bay, the Hubbard Glacier, at the stop in Skagway, we rode the train up Chillkoot Pass, retracing the trail that the many prospectors took on the way to the gold fields in the gold rush of 1898, 99. The crown jewel of the six days that we were on the land part of the tour was, for me Denali Park. What an immense park it is, and if one is fortunate, a view of Denali itself, capps a 60 mile ride into this absolute jewel. 30 percent of the visitors to the park get to see this huge mountain. Denali is the largest mountain on earth. Everest is taller as everyone knows, but in terms of mass, Denali is the biggest mountain on this planet.",

        "text": "If you ever are to visit Alaska, this is a MUST SEE. The park limits private vehicles from entering in to the park completely (I think you can only go 15 miles in). You need to take a tour bus into the park which I highly recommend because many of the guides have spent time hiking, camping, etc in the park. Our guide Peter is a sub teacher in his other job but does this during the tourist season. He was well versed in the eco system, the animals, the history of the park and all that have traveled through the park since the early 1900s. You have the option of a 6-8 hr trip or a longer one. We chose the 6-8 hr because we do have an 8 yr old. We were even leery that he would hang on for 6-8 hr but let me tell you, he did and loved every minute of it. Part of the draw to this trip is that everyone on the bus participates in eyeballing animals. On our trip, we saw a momma bear and her 2 cubs whom gave chase to a male bear, caribou & their little ones, moose, porcupine, sheep and some birds. They film what you see on your trip and you can purchase that for $35-which they send to you via mail after editing. The mountains that you see throughout this great park are spectacular. They will take you to a spot to see Mt McKinley (aka Denali). This is hard to see in its entirety because of the clouds but we were able to see quite a bit. There isn't a bad Kodak moment and well worth the effort for the early rise. We did the early AM trip and when I say early..I mean..EARLY. They pick up at various large hotels in Denali starting at 530AM so be forewarned. Don't worry to doll up-no one will care at least I don't think so because I am sure I may have scared a few bear with my morning hair. The tour bus (which is a school bus configuration) we took included a light snack (reindeer sausage, cheese, bread, & bottled water). We opted to have our hotel pack us a lunch as kids aren't so thrilled with the bus snack option. They do make potty break stops often. Great trip for all ages.",

Had to show a photo ID to board. Drink service was at your seats. Meal service by appointment was downstairs. Live commentary for the entire trip by Helen. She had fun stories to tell. They did not allow the large camera bag on board with a couple of other larger rollies. They stowed them in a small compartment right by the door. We had Chena Club car \u2013 Row 16 ABCD. The car was actually Holland\u2019s car, not Princess. So far the left side, seats AB, were the better side for sites along the river. The windows are large and you can see views from either side. The ride was fairly smooth and quiet with a large comfortable area for your legs and feet. There was the ability to climb over the person sitting next to you without disturbing them. We did notice that towards the back of the car it was nosier with plate/meal service noise. And towards the front the blender noise for mixed drinks was prominent. Abby was our drink server.

It takes a commitment to get there, but it is so worth the drive, train ride and tour bus on the single gravel road. This may seem odd, but the tour busses on only one road is what keeps the wilderness wild. The Alaskan and Outer ranges are majestic even if you aren't one of the lucky ones who gets to see Denali. Polychrome Pass is named for its multicolor hues. We saw moose, dall sheep, rock squirrels, the state bird willow ptarmigan plus other birds, snow hares, caribou and grizzly bears with cubs.

The tram leaves every 15 minutes and only takes a few minutes. When you exit the tram you walk up a ramp to the second floor of the building, One whole wall of the building is raw cliff which has dozens of large dinosaur bone fossils still embedded in the rock. The rock wall is two stories high so after studying the top of the wall you can go downstairs to get a closer look and even touch the fossils. There is a map available for $1 that shows which bone goes with which dinosaur. (there are also several interactive displays that identify the bones.) The opposite wall has murals and replica skeletons of some of the dinosaurs found in the quarry. There is a fascinating 7 minute black and white video made back when the quarry was first being worked that shows how the bones were dug up, covered in plaster, crated and shipped back east where they were cleaned and studied and assembled into full skeletons.

I'd recommend the book even if you skip reading all of the points, there are a number of petroglyphs & pictographs along the route that you don't want to miss. Some take a bit of uphill hiking which is refreshing when you are doing a lot of driving. At Josie's Cabin, the road ends and you will find an outhouse (whew) and two side trails up canyons where she ran her livestock. We hiked both canyons and would recommend them especially if it is hot...cool places to end up.",

We had stayed in Vernal & that was only 12 miles from it. 1st stop was the Quarry Visitors Center where you pay a fee of $10 or use the Senior Pass. Got some info, watched the movie & looked at the exhibits. Then we did the Ranger tour over to Quarry Exhibit Hall with Ranger Tiffany from Sheboygan, WI. She was very helpful & made the experience more interesting. The exhibit hall has a very interesting cliff wall with hundreds of bones partially visible. Next we did the Cub Creek Rd. Tour of the Tilted Rocks with 15 points of interested covered in a brochure. At Pt. 14, hubby hiked up to see additional petroglyphs. I could see the lizard & flute player petroglyphs from the parking lot but couldn't do the hike due to a sore knee. The last Pt. is the Jossie Bassett cabin & a 20 minute easy hike on the Box Canyon Trail. We spent half a day here but you could easily spend much more time in this area. There's another section of Dinosaur Nat'l Monument on the Colorado side that we didn't get to this trip. Hope we get back to finish what we started.",

The paved parking lot is large enough to accommodate cars and busses and is a allows for a short walk to the visitor's center. The Quarry Exhibit Hall located in the back of the visitor's center can be approached by shuttle every 15 minutes in the summer, walked although it is steep but a short distance or as I did in the Fall drive up with your car. The Quarry Exhibit Hall is an excavation site that has 1,400 fossils. They are Late Jurassic. There are exhibits along the side wall and an upper and lower viewing area for the fossils encased in the wall. For one dollar you can purchase an activity book to further explain the fossils in the wall. Electronic information boards are spaced all along the viewing area and really add to your knowledge of what you are seeing. There are ranger lead hikes along the Fossil Trail or you can go it alone. Some of the steeper inclines have very interesting fossils. After you leave the Quarry Exhibit Hall, you might want to take the 11 stop Auto Drive Tour. Most stops are a short walk to the exhibits. For $1 you can buy a booklet which explains what each stop offers and how much of a hike it is. There are petroglyphs, ancient settlements and history and geology exhibits. It's a national park so any passes you have will be honored. I have the senior pass and used it. It can be an all day event or an hour but either way it's a wonderful experience for all ages.",

        "text": "The National Monument has 2 Visitor Centers; the one near Dinosaur, Colorado is open seasonally and has NO dinosaur fossils. If you want to see one of the richest fossil beds open to the public in North America, visit the Quarry Visitor Center accessible from Vernal or Jensen, Utah. The Quarry is generally open year round; fossils were deposited in the rock layer about 150 million years ago. You can actually touch some of the fossils, a feature children seem to especially enjoy. A reconstruction of an Allosaur is on the first floor of the quarry. If you have only half a day, a visit to the quarry is a must. If you have more time, try to participate in one or more of the ranger led short hikes and/or some of the volunteer programs. When I was there one volunteer had a special telescope allowing us to view spots and prominences on the sun. At a night program (you can access these at night without having to stay at the camping areas) a knowledgeable volunteer provided telescopes and views of the spectacular night sky. There is also a road tour (maps at the visitor center) which can take a couple of hours depending on how many of the short hikes to petroglyph areas you might take from the overlooks. Camping is also available at 2 areas and will allow you to explore the area's ecosystems. This is a great park to visit for half a day to several days depending on your time and interests. There is a $10 per car entry fee unless you have a Golden Age Passport (62 and older).",

The hike lasts about 90 minutes. It starts above at the quarry and returns you to the visitor center below. Then we took the drive along Cub Creek. We bought the dollar pamphlet that explained each numbered stop. The petroglyphs along the way are not to be missed. There is some short hiking to reach them but well worth it. At Josie's cabin at the end, there are two hikes you can take. The landscape is beautiful all along the way. Be sure to pack a picnic lunch because there is no where to get food. We went to Smith's in Vernal before going to the monument. After the drive we went back to the quarry to see the wall of dinosaur bones. It is amazing. There are so many that it is hard to know where to look first. We arrived around 9:45am and did not leave the monument until 3:45pm. We were tired from the hiking in the heat, but so glad we had the time to see everything. That is the Utah side. ",

The dinosaur fossils in this area represent the congregation of the creatures in this water-rich area during a period of drought where the dinosaurs ultimately died, settled in the riverbed; were then covered by sand and preserved. That\u2019s the current theory of why the creatures are so prolific there. The Visitor Center, while desolate, is modern and easy to reach. It is where you stop to pay the $20 per vehicle user fee and get park insights from the staff. Then you drive <1km to the new building that houses the enclosed fossil-rich river bed, now nearly vertical given the earth\u2019s movements over thousands of years, where you can view hundreds and hundreds of fossils that were preserved. If you have questions, the staff has answers. To get a different perspective, visit the upstairs too. This national monument is a perfect venue to teach children about the dinosaurs and archeology.

It takes about a half hour or so to get there and is a beautiful drive. The road turns from pavement to groomed gravel as you leave the desert scape of Grand Staircase to the aspen and pine of Dixie National Forest. It was absolutely beautiful. It was at the very top of the mountain and we were I the clouds. The campground was well maintained, they had grills, a fire pit with a removable grill as well, a table, tent area and a bear box. If not familiar, a bear box are becoming more common. They are large steal box with a door that you put all things \"smelly\". Everything from food to toothpaste. Anything else, locked in your car to the very least. Bear are prevelent in the tops of mountains but will keep there distance unless they smell an easy meal. As a sidenote, several years ago a boy lost his life( not in Dixie) when a bear smelled fragrant shampoo.) Get my point? Anyway, the odds are slim to nil you'll see bears or cougars or the like. I did not, had I I'd want to know where the kids are, how to handle a confrontation( I do) and find my camera! We did see dear, birds of prey and when we walked over to the lake and were greeted with a slap of a beaver's tail on the water near the small boat dock. Other that some unique looking water fowl, the fish jumping , Mr. Beaver and the few other campers that couldn't be seen from our camp( bonus) it was as if we had the whole place to ourselves. After setting up we went with hot dogs over the fire then I was going dutch over cooking from morning to night from fish I was planning to catch to a roast with veggies to pineapple upside down cake not to mention the egg, bacon and country potato's for breakfast. But alas it was all for not. We retired for the evening only to awake to 4 INCHES of snow!!!!! It was gorgeus but....1,2,3,4!!!!! Four inches! In short, it altered our trip. We packed up, said goodbye to Mr. Beaver, (who was no doubt comfortably warm and dry in his mansion of a dam) and abandoned our $35 tent. Our plan when we weren't at camp was to do the Hell's Backbone trail which starts near camp. This is not a hike, it is a small occasionally groomed 30 mile jagged road that is OK for our little car unless churned up by 4 wheelers after inclement weather. At the end is the town of Boulder, the home of the renowned restaurant, Hell' s Backbone grill.( look for my review on that). So after dodging the looming rain for the first 3/days, we not only got snow instead but had no place to stay but under the clouded over stars. We ended back the way we came, back on byway 12 and thru Escalante, passed Calf Creek Falls( see my review on that) and up and over what's called the Hog's Back. Top of a bald mountain, certain death on both sides of the road with snow turned rain and fog. Mine you this was Byway 12 again so it was awesome but would have been nice to see the vastness of both Grand Staircase on one side and Dixie N. F. on the other side of the Hog. We eventually made it to our next stop Hell\"s Backbone Grill and the Anasazi National Monument( see review on this).",

Admission to the park was $175 per person, which I thought was steep going into the park and coming out of the park. Upon arrival floods of people disembarked and either snorkeled or took the tour of the fort. We decided to walk around the fort then snorkel (since gear isn't available until around 1045-11am). Snorkeling was nice, but there are better places to snorkel in Florida. We were lucky the sun came out and allowed us to see the coral and fish around the fort. We were able to spend about 4 hours at the park. Wish the park were closer so that more time could be spent and admission cheaper. Would have been more worth the price. ",

        "text": "We finally made the trip to the Dry Tortugas. Each time we've stayed in Key West, it's been for three or four days \u2014 this time was a 10-day stay. Previously, we didn't want to expend an entire day visiting this remote national park \u2014 it appears to be the 7th least visited national park in the system; the least visited is above the arctic circle. Anyway, to get there you have to go either by ferry (a 2 1/2 hour trip each way) or by seaplane. Prices on the ferry are $175 per person (you save $10 if you are in the old group; you also get entrance fees back if you have a national park pass). A lunch is provided along with a continental type breakfast (included in your fare). This was a fascinating day. Fort Jefferson has an interesting history starting before the Civil War. The waters are pristine. You can snorkel or swim. Camping is allowed; however, you should do your homework before attempting to overnight there. One recommendation: BOOK EARLY!!! We booked a week out and were limited as to what days were available. Also remember, your trip can be cancelled if the weather is stormy \u2014 that is determined by the captain of the ferry. Weather can be lousy there while it looks nice in Key West . . . or vice versa. If you decide to take the seaplane instead of the ferry, the prices are much higher. Check it out to see what is best for you.",

If you don't camp out, I don't believe it's worth your time to take the ferry. It ends up being about 5 hours on a ferry and 4 hours on the island, and the ferry ride itself isn't particularly entertaining. BUT, if you do the appropriate planning, doing a night or two of camping is the same price + a $15-$20 camping fee, and you'll have over 24 hours at this unique park. Camping is definitely not for everyone (and definitely not for younger kids), but if you have pretty basic camping skills, you'll find yourself mesmerized by the isolation from the world that you get once the ferry and seaplanes leave. I would highly recommend this for anybody that is looking to escape the world for a couple days to just simply relax and explore the ocean and Fort Jefferson.",

But something else always seemed to take precedence. Recently, we finally committed to going, and OMG, we fully underestimated the sheer beauty and wonder of this place. If you enjoy natural beauty, this is a MUST! Choose a warm, sunny day, and commit to a wonderful, daylong trip; you won't be sorry. Yes, the boat ride out is long, but eat breakfast, breathe the sea air, visit with passengers, and be patient because the prize awaits. Make sure to stroll both the lower and upper moat paths all (or most) of the way around, try out the 20 minute talk or hour long tour if you're interested in the history, bask on the beach if you want, or fish. We tried the snorkelling, and saw fish yes, coral no. Not much of a snorkeling experience for us. BUT, then find a spot on the lower moat path, sit down, dangle your feet over the water facing the lighthouse on Loggerhead Key, and just gaze at the incredible array of colors in your vision 360 degrees around you. Feel the sun on your face, the breeze in your hair, and release that deep breath you've been holding. It's sublime. At 2:45, board the boat, and make sure to get a seat on the upper deck, facing the back of the boat. Grab an adult beverage, put your sunglasses in place, and just bask in the glow and ocean view all the way back to KW. The boat staff were fun, everything is well organized, and Joanne in the office was an amazing ambassador for the trip. Book it, and book it early, and don't hesitate like we did!",

        "text": "Dry Tortugas National Park is located 70 miles west of Key West, Florida, in the Gulf of Mexico so you must decide whether to take a two-hour chartered boat trip or a scenic and quicker but more expensive seaplane flight to Fort Jefferson and the westernmost and most isolated of the Florida Keys. Believe me, it's worth the time and/or the expense. The park, established in 1935, covers 64,701 acres and is noted for its abundant sea life, tropical bird breeding grounds, colorful coral reefs and legends of sea wrecks and sunken treasures. The park's centerpiece is Fort Jefferson, a massive but unfinished coastal fortress, the largest brick masonry structure in the Western Hemisphere, which is composed of more than 16 million bricks. It attracts only 63,000 visitors annually. Activities include snorkeling, picnicking, bird watching, camping, scuba diving, kayaking and saltwater fishing. The most famous person imprisoned at Fort Jefferson was Dr. Samuel Mudd, who was convicted of conspiracy in the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln. The first European to see Dry Tortugas was Juan Ponce de Leon, who visited on June 21, 1513. He caught 160 sea turtles and subsequently referred to the islands as the \"Tortugas\" or turtles. Why are they called Dry? Because there is no fresh water on the island. It is a bird-watchers' heaven with 299 species listed as residents. Of these, only eight species frequently nest within the park, including the brown pelican, mourning dove and magnificent frigatebird. Each year several bird guides offer tours of the park during April and early May when daily bird lists can often reach 100 or more species. It's an all-day activity. By boat, you leave at 8 a.m. and return at 5:30 p.m. Breakfast and lunch are provided. All at a cost of $135 per person. And they even provide snorkeling equipment. Have a nice trip.",

The 8am flight gives you private island time before the ferry of over 100 people arrive. Plus you don't waste half of a day. We also saw all the keys and islands, ship wrecks, and marine life by taking the seaplane. It was spectacular. There are NO facilities on the island of Fort Jefferson. You bring your own water and snacks. Try to be mindful of limiting your footprint by bringing minimal needs and leaving nothing behind. Take your trash back with you. There are portable toilets on site but nothing else. No cell service here and it's refreshing not to have it. There are beaches you can enjoy in tranquility. The surf and current are strong so snorkeling is not amazing but it's funny to see all the small fish surround you in the water. We wanted to camp but it wasn't in our schedule. Watch the weather before booking to camp. You're truly alone except for rangers. Expect to leave salty and sandy all over. Take minimal needs as if you are going to the beach with no storage area. The Fort is small enough to fully walk in a short time. You can even walk the breaker wall on the outside of the fort. Bring a good camera. The real life colors are spectacular and you may never be back again. Make sure to tip your captain or pilot for the extra attention and tour to and from the island. Expect to enjoy this place in your own way while respecting others space and thier desire to have thier own personal experience. Trip advisor has information to the transportation services. The Fort has a small fee paid in advisable to your transportation company or by cash. USD$. There is a gift shop somewhere but we didn't waste our time there. Enjoy!",

They sell Dramamine for $1 each so we bought & took some just in case. The seas were a bit rough & there were quite a few people getting sick. The crew was always there to help them. Thankfully my friend & I were fine. The fort itself was ok, lots of history that I didn't know about. Once we walked around the fort we grabbed lunch on the boat, which was also decent. They offered tuna, potato salad, cold cuts & such. After lunch we decided to try & snorkel. They had told us that the last few days there weren't that many fish around but we hoped for the best. Unfortunately, We did not see anything. The boat ride back was the same as going & the crew were all helpful again to them. I'm glad I finally went on this excursion but don't think I would pay that kind of money to go again. You don't get back to Key West until 5:30pm, it's a very long day.",

This outing is Ideal (though not cheap) for couples, campers, or families with kids wishing to learn about 19th century history, spend a day at sea, and snorkel in the gin clear waters of the Caribbean. The fort is accessible only by boat or seaplane, the former being the more popular and least expensive. We took the Yankee Freedom, a fast, aluminum hulled catamaran, costing about a $340.00 for two. The crossing takes about two hours each way, leaving about four hours to tour the fort, snorkel, or picnic on the island. Both a buffet breakfast and luncheon are served on the boat. For us the meals were the only disappointing aspects of the trip, consisting of very limited, predictable, and pedestrian choices of food, albeit they were fresh and served cold. We nearly missed the lunch because we missed the announcement, if there were one, saying that it would be served strictly between noon and one, a time when most people were touring or snorkeling. Still, we didn't go for the meal. The ride over was smooth on the day we traveled. And in route we saw numerous turtles, birds and other wildlife. The park itself is a sanctuary for birds, turtles and other wildlife, which were numerous. The boat was efficiently run, very smooth for those concerned about sea sickness (depending on the seas of course), and the staff was professional, if a bit aloof. Tours were offered by someone who seemed knowledgeable, but very chatty. The boat is senior friendly but might be challenging for anyone with difficulty in walking or getting in and out of fairly small and tight seating. There were plenty of seats though, and table space for eating or playing cards. All in all, we very much enjoyed this trip, the park, the fort, and a day out of Key West.",

Breakfast was bagels, fruit, cereal - basics but as much as you wanted. Explored the fort on our own and then snorkeled for a while before going back into the fort to escape the sun. Lunch was sandwiches, fruit, sodas, chips, salads - basic. Snorkeling gear provided. On the ride back, they opened their concession and bar ($5-6) for drinks like rum runners, daiquiris etc. Ride back was a bit bumpy but manageable. The weather on our trip was perfect! There was plenty of time to relax and enjoy this experience. Tip: Wear higher spf sunscreen than you normally would - the island is the only thing out there and no shade trees.",

Yes, the cost for that boat ride is $175 a person and there is pretty much only the ferry or a sea plane available as transportation, unless you own a boat. But, the investment is worth it. This small piece of land is so beautiful, it is indescribable. The water around the park is like none I've ever seen. Besides the fort, the park is also a bird sanctuary. There were thousands of birds in the park during the first week of June. A good pair of binoculars is all you need if you are interested in bird watching. Photography is another great past time. The fort ruins, the grounds, even the moat walk around the fort offers lots of photo opportunities, be it landscape or wildlife. We did not camp, but that is available. The campsite area is very small and I suspect needs to be booked far in advance. With the ferry ride, you only end up with about 3 hours at the park itself. I found myself running out of time and I was just equipped with cameras and binoculars. You can also snorkel around the perimeter of the park. Not my thing, but some people in our group did and said it was ok. I suppose that activity is always hit or miss, although I got a few decent photos of fish in the water just from walking the moat wall, so it seemed like there were fish to see while snorkeling. All in all, I was so happy we decided to take this trip. Photographers and birders will love it. I am both, so I was in my glory.",

You can take a seaplane which cost more but is only a 40 minute flight from the Key West airport and also includes snorkeling gear and a cooler with water and soft drinks. You can also take a private boat but again - 2 1/4 hrs. to get there at least! We chose the seaplane for times sake and do not regret it at all. The scenery is stunning! - we saw sea turtles, rays, sharks and fish. We saw sunken ships. We saw underwater desert - with sand dunes that were amazing. Everyone gets a window seat and headphones to hear a little of the history and story of what you are seeing. We had a little over 2 hours on the island and since we have snorkeled many times and were not interested in that - that was plenty of time for us!

The big question that visitors have to answer is how much time do they want to spend touring/exploring the fort, snorkeling, and just walking around Garden Key versus how much money do they want to spend to get there. We took the Yankee Freedom III ferry and paid $175 each. The trip took 2.5 hours each way which left us with just over 4 hours on the island. That really wasn't enough time to explore properly. The seaplane option leaves you with over 6 hours of island time, but will set you back over $550 each for a full day. The 5 (total) hours on the ferry seemed to drag on towards the end, but they fed us well and kept us entertained. We were told that the view from the seaplane was amazing. A tough choice.",

        "text": "Pictures do not do this place justice. It is just so beautiful and unique. A bunch of random info about the experience.... We booked 8 weeks ahead of time for a visit in March, during the heart of the busy Spring Break season, and we almost didn't get to go. All of the days we wanted were sold out, so we had to settle on the one day available during our stay and switch other plans around. BOOK EARLY! We took the ferry and for 2 adults / 2 kids it was $600. We would have loved to do the plane trip but it was too costly for us. The ferry experience was wonderful. We arrived at the dock at 7am and waited for boarding. There is an ATM at the port station and a vending machine but nothing else. I was hoping for some coffee but there is nothing like that at the port station so bring your own. We brought suncreen, towels, wet suits, and some of our own snorkel gear. For a storage fee (not sure how much) you can also bring your own kayak or paddleboard. This is a nice feature for those folks who camp at the Fort overnight. You can camp up to 3 days, and although we weren't camping this time, we hope to do that in the future. The ride over included a breakfast of cereals, yogurts, fruit, bagels / muffins, meats, coffee, juice, and milk. The ride was smooth and the captain actually slowed the boat at one point and circled a pod of dolphins so we could take pictures and ohh and ahh over their beauty. There were probably 12 dolphins in the water, amazing. There are concessions available for purchase on the boat and they take cash or credit cards. Very good prices. $1 for candy bars and little snacks. For drinks they have bottled waters and sodas. After 2pm you can get Sangria $5, beers $4, and a full bar with rum, vodka, whiskey etc. Even frozen drinks! We signed up for the tour at 11am and they have one other tour later in the day. These tours filled up quickly and you had to sign up since only a limited number of folks can go on the tour . The tour takes an hour, very good, very informative. We did the tour, then had lunch. Lunch was chicken salad, potato salad, lunch meats / sandwich fixings, with chips and cookies. Everything was good. After lunch, we put on our wet suits, as the water is about 75 degrees, and snorkeled along the moat walls and the reef. The reef is a short swim away from the moat. Nice snorkel, on the average side, but the setting makes up for any thing missing in the snorkel experience. We saw lots of star fish, urchins, conch, and lots of shallow water fish. Very cool submerged anchors that looked ancient. After our snorkel, we rinsed our gear on the dock (they provide gear or you can bring your own, but they do not have wet suits available) and then we rinsed off in a fresh water shower on the back of the boat. We went back on the fort and visited the gift shop, which is small but has some cute stuff. We bought a Dry Tortugas postcard and then stamped it in the lobby with one of the National Parks Centennial stamps. We were back on board for a 2:45pm departure and a smooth ride home. There are no restrooms at the fort so you use the ferry's restrooms through out the day. The interior cabins of the boat were freezing and we spent our time in there wrapped in our towels. The exterior seating is nice but was too windy for the kids. They sell nice souvenirs on the boat too, including playing cards and tshirts etc. We tipped the crew on our way off the boat, they do a wonderful job. The Fort is so impressive, such a one of a kind structure, that I won't even try to cover how cool it is. Take your time, and climb every level. It's a memorable experience!!",

Fort Jefferson is the main attraction and it is so worth taking the longer tour of the Fort. It is 90 minutes long and every question is answered. Controlling the cleanliness is important so no plastic water bottles are allowed therefore you should bring a reusable bottle and please do not litter. The moat around the fort is clean and shallow but care should be taken with walking close to the edge. You can snorkel in designated areas and the equipment is included in the fee from the ferry.

It was a full 2 1/2 hour ride out to the park that included a few minutes stop to observe dolphins. The trip was very nice in the calm weather.

I was pleasantly surprised at the reasonable cost of mixed drinks ($5) and beer ($3) on the trip. All of the boat staff were friendly and helpful. Being able to rinse off the salt water in an outdoor shower on the deck before going to the changing area on the dock was a definite plus. The trip overall is a wonderful day activity for families. It does require mobility so might not be good for elderly or those with mobility issues. ",

You can spend the day on the beautiful pristine beaches, snorkeling, our touring the fort. All 3 options are available. Since Key West is not known for its beaches, we opted for a relaxing day on the beach. There is a resident salt water crocodile that made the day a little more exciting. You can also stay and camp here. This is a great place for families too as there is something for everyone to do. At $170 its a little pricey but it was a great day. The crew on the Yankee Freedom certainly made it fun too!",

Reserving a spot on one of the high speed catamarans is the easiest and most efficient way to go. A round trip ticket that typically includes lunch and drinks, free snorkeling equipment as well as a free tour of Fort Jefferson and the Dry Tortugas, runs anywhere from $170 to $190 bucks a person. Yes, I know that seems VERY pricey...but you're traveling 70 miles south of Key West and getting to see some absolutely spectacular scenery on the way to your destination. The trip is just a little over two hours, it really depends on weather. I highly recommend taking the Yankee Freedom. Beautiful boat, wonderul staff and a nice, smooth trip. Once you've arrived at the Dry Torgutas, there's plenty to do and see, but you've got a lot to fit into the 5 hours you're on land! Park rangers are typically on hand and are fountains of knowledge pertaining to the fort, its history and the waters that surround it. Some of the BEST snorkeling you will ever have the opportunity to partake in is located right here at the fort. We encountered plenty of amazing sealife! If you enjoy nature and history, this trip is something you have to add to your bucket list. Overnight camping is available, but it's a complete pack in/pack out situation. This means whatever you need, you have to bring it with you, fresh water included! Camping slots sell out quickly and are extremely limited, so book early. Don't forget to pack dry clothes, sunscreen and a camera...and if you find that you tend to get a little seasick, some Dramamine isn't a bad idea either. ",

It was an easy ride and there was plenty of seating and restrooms. Breakfast was bagels, cereal and fruit. It was a very nice spread for a ferry. When we reached the island we walked the fort while the crew got the snorkeling gear ready. The fort was AMAZING! You can take a guided tour but we opted not to do it. We swam out to the coral reef and the snorkeling was really good. Lots of types of coral and a great variety of tropical fish. Moon jellies were the only downfall. We swam back for lunch on the ferry. It was cold cuts, chicken salad, and peanut butter but the bread was delicious and there was fresh lettuce and tomatoes. They also served potato salad, fruit salad and cookies. You could purchase beverages, water was provided. You could also purchase hot dogs, burgers, and other items. After lunch we went back out and snorkeled a different area around the fort. They provided you with a map of all the great areas for snorkeling. At 2:00 pm the bar opened. The ferry left the island at 3:00 pm. On the way back to Key West dolphins were racing the boat. It was so cool! I highly recommend this trip. Trip is $170 for an adult and $125 for children.

The 2-1/2 hour ride can be difficult and if you are prone to seasickness beware. On our most recent trip about a third of the passengers were given barf bags and most made use of them. No matter how sunny and beautiful it seems at the terminal this ride can be tough. Don't take this trip after stumbling out of Sloppy Joe's at 2:00 AM and don't get on that boat without taking Dramamine about an hour before you leave (and probably another just before stepping on). If you start out sitting in an enclosed area, eat your breakfast noting that you might be seeing it again. If you start to feel the slightest bit queasy when sitting inside get outside on deck immediately and hold on to the rail looking forward with some wind in your face. That might do the trick if you're not too late. The ride out is not particularly scenic. The destination is magical. The snorkeling is good and if the ride back is calm, the frozen drinks on the Yankee Freedom are great. For four people of various ages this trip cost us about $600.00 so it's not cheap but in terms of value we are never disappointed.

We took the two tours available and learned a lot about the fort during both of these. We spent too much time on lunch and didn't have time to walk around the island by ourselves. We'd recommend walking around the moat by yourself to really enjoy the remoteness of the island. It was too cool to snorkel when we were there. ",

The ranger on site was interesting and the display in the visitor center is well done. The ferry crew also gave shortened tours of the fort, but we did the walking one on our own. This is not an easy place to walk, as there are steep steps inside to the top tiers, so many elderly wandered the grounds then went to one of the beaches. The fort is maintained in original condition as much as possible, so no guard rails; be aware of this if you bring children. It never seemed overrun with visitors, even when all 175 of us from the ferry were ashore. Worth the $$ to visit. Used our National Park Pass for free admittance.",

The Yankee Freedom is a great ship: very clean, comfortable, and a great crew. Brought our kayaks down from Savannah, GA. We had an amazing time snorkeling, circumnavigating Garden Key in our kayaks, fishing, relaxing on the south beach, watching the sunsets, strolling the moat, exploring the fort, and stargazing. We also located the coral heads off Garden Key. The highlight of our trip was our paddle to Loggerhead Key with Mike and Olga. It was exhausting but well worth the effort. If you have access to a kayak, don't miss Little Africa. Thanks to Ranger Adam for the great fishing tips and keeping us safe. We did not see Carlos the crocodile but twenty nine Cubans landed on Garden Key while we were there. Got great pictures of them and the Coast Guard Cutter that came to take them to Miami. Our only regret was not enough time at DTNP. Tip: If you are camping, plan this trip very carefully. Make sure you have match light and a sterno stove. We cooked chili and chicken curry and froze it for the trip and grilled asparagus and garlic toast. Our best meal was the grilled mutton snapper we caught. Lunches can be bought from the Yankee Freedom for $7, as well as ice for $7 a bag and water for $2 a bottle. We ate yogurt and fig bars for breakfast every morning and made great coffee with our sterno stove and French press. We brought a 7 gallon water container for cooking, washing, and doing dishes plus about a case of bottled water (some frozen), ginger ale, and coconut water. We had ample water. Bring tin foil, baby wipes and camp mats. You will need a VHF radio if you plan to kayak to Loggerhead Key. Bring your favorite libation - it makes for a great, relaxing evening.",

To me this was my chance to see the Dry Tortugas and check it off my bucket list. There had been a storm the night before and the seas were very rough for the last 45 minutes of the boat ride. The crew was great and prepared for a boat load of sick passengers. I did not envy their job. It is a long ride but the island is beautiful. The fort is very interesting to walk around. The seas were too rough to go swimming or snorkeling but I was told by several people that it is some of the best snorkeling in the keys. It was nice just sitting by the water watching the waves crash in. So even though we didn\u2019t get to take full advantage of everything this trip usually has to offer I still had a very enjoyable day. You do need to set aside the whole day. You are supposed to be at the boat by 7am and it returns around 5:30pm. The boat ride is about 2.5 hours and you have about 4 hours on land. It is expensive at $170 per person for which you get the boat ride, breakfast, lunch, snorkel equipment and a guided tour of the fort. The food is so-so at best. There is a coupon code in local brochures for $10 if booked on line. I did book on line but the week before we went down so I didn\u2019t have the code. I did get a $10 refund for having a National Parks pass. It is a unique opportunity to visit a hard to get to park and for me was worth the time, expense and queasiness.",

        "text": "We camped on the Dry Tortugas for 2 nights in February. There are various ways to get to the island, but the cheapest and most efficient way for campers to visit is by using the Yankee Freedom ferry. As campers we were required to arrive 30 minutes earlier than anyone else. We decided to come an entire hour early to avoid a log jam with other campers. We parked at the end of the street and unloaded our gear. There were various push carts around which allowed us to easily transport everything. After unloading everything, we dropped the car off in a parking deck a block away for $13 a day. Being early there were no lines to check-in. The captain gave us a rundown on what to expect and then we waited around for the boat to leave. On the ride over there are air conditioned areas below and on top of the boat. These rooms have tables which are convenient for eating breakfast. There are also outside seats on the top deck. All these seats, except the row closest to the room are baking in the sun the entire time. Breakfast was simple (hard boiled eggs, yogurt, juice, milk, ham, bread, jam and cereal). The ride takes a couple of hours and there isn't a whole lot to see. Most people piled off the boat as soon as we arrived, but as campers we were asked to stay behind and listen to a speech from the park ranger. After a 5 minute rundown, we were released with our gear waiting on the dock. I would walk right past your gear and head straight to the campsite. There are limited shady spots to pitch a tent so try to have one person in your group secure a spot and then go back to get your gear. After pitching your tent and paying your camping fees ($3/person/night), I'd recommend grabbing lunch on the boat. The lunch is pretty good. It is all you can eat cold cuts, with decent sandwich fixings. There is also a pretty tasty tuna salad and potato salad. After lunch we decided to snorkel. The equipment the boat provides is decent, but if you have your own gear I'd recommend that instead. You do get to keep the gear the entire time you are camping. We decided to snorkel around the moat the first day. There were some great coral fans and several species of fish. We also spent some time around the South coaling pylons. There you will find great schools of fish. After spending over 90 minutes in the water we went back to the boat where we were able to shower. With no water on the island, these WARM showers on the boat were great. Every day while camping we would spend the mornings getting dirty and then come back to the boat before 2:45 to take a shower and be clean for the evening activities. At 3:00 the boat and throngs of people leave and the island becomes a tranquil island paradise.",

        "text": "Dry Torguas is breathtaking and unlike any excursion our family had experienced. It's fairly expensive ($900+ for six of us), but the Freedom Ferry took great care of the passengers. Not sure feeding us a big breakfast prior to a 2 hour boat ride is the best idea, as an hour into the trip most of the passengers were vomiting. The seas weren't even rough, so plan accordingly. It rained the day before our trip, but the waters looked clear and amazing from the boat. We were fitted with good quality snorkel gear and headed to the north beach. It's safe to just claim a beach spot and leave your belongings for the day, as you come and go from the fort and in and out of the water. Unfortunately, we should have waited one more day because once in the beautiful blue water the visibility underneath was murky. It was disappointing; however, we ventured on and snorkeled for several hours, just making the best of it, but knowing we were missing out on seeing the beautiful fish beneath us. They serve an awesome big lunch early enough for everyone's stomach to settle before heading back on the 2 hour boat ride. Take your own water bottles, take Dramamine, a few snacks, a book, cards, etc. Our boat ride flew by, but other people got a bit restless because for the majority of the boat ride you are simply surrounded by water with no way to gauge the distance traveled.",

        "text": "This not NOT an inexpensive trip. Or a short one. You'll need to buy a small plane ticket, or have your own (not small) boat, or hop on the Yankee Freedom ferry. The plane is quick, a boat is slow, and the Yankee Freedom hauls butt at 27.5 knots...and STILL takes almost 2 1/2 hours to get there! It's Dry Tortugas is 70 miles west of Key West. It's OUT THERE. We took the ferry, with is about $170 for each of us. For that you get the ride out and back, some information, breakfast and lunch and snorkel gear if you want it. There's a pay bar for the ride back. The folks on the boat did a good job. Once you get there you can snorkel (it's pretty good if you go to the reef), just OK at the moat wall...although we did see a monster (six foot?) ray parked on the bottom in the sand. Cool! And/or you can explore the fort. It's a BIG fort with three levels, a lot of acreage and a lot to see. There is great signage that walks you through life at the fort and facets of the fort itself. We took our time and it took us about two hours to do it all. Well worth it. You have 3 1/2 hours on the island, so fitting in snorkeling and lunch and exploring will keep you hopping. Note: There are guided tours of the fort.l They are very good. OR you can get a self-guided book tour with is also very good, especially when combined with the signage. Note 2: Take some water with you when you're exploring the fort. They call it DRY Tortugas for a reason. Note 3: Best snorkeling is the coral reef west of the fort, about 200' from the moat wall. The next best snorkeling is among the pilings of the old wharfs. Note 4: If you want to sit in the open air on the way out to the island, go straight up top. Those seats fill up fast. They serve you breakfast and if you get it and eat it on the main indoor deck you 'll be stuck there for two hours. Grab food and head topside OR leave your partner up top and go down and one of you get breakfast for both of you. You'll likely finish it before the boat gets very far and you're set!",

We booked our tickets online months ago and it was well worth the $320. The sea was a bit choppy on out trip. The crew said the swells were on average 3 to 4 feet with some 6 footers thrown in. Unfortunately this made many people sick. The crew was constantly taking care of the little white barf bags, I think those guys are paid by the pound! Seriously, I didn't find it bad but after two hours I realized why I don't spend a lot of time on the water. Ft. Jefferson was fantastic. Our guide gave us a great talk with lots of historic information. We didn't snorkel but many others did and loved it. Several people fished and ocean kayaked. Several we're camping and we picked up a few campers who were returning to Key West. Breakfast and lunch was served on the boat. ",

        "text": "If you're like most people, you're probably clueless about what and where the Dry Tortugas is/are. After our trip to Fort Jefferson/Dry Tortugas aboard the Yankee Trader, we got answers and had a fantastic time. In a nutshell: The Dry Tortugas are tiny islands that are part of the Keys and are even further away from the mainland than Key West. The main attraction is Fort Jefferson (where the ferry anchors) which totally encompasses one of the islands, leaving only a narrow swath of white sand beaches around the perimeter. The water is the clearest and warmest that I ever seen. Swimming and snorkeling were out of this world. You can camp there overnight if you go through a lot of trouble\u2026but it's probably worth it. It's not cheap. Only one ferry boat goes out once a day. But go. It's one of those adventures that you need to take on. We ordered up our expensive ferry tickets on line to save a bit of money. Breakfast and lunch are served on board the ship and the food is fine.The snorkeling instructions and equipment are included, as is the entrance to the fort (since we hold National Park Passes, we had that amount deducted from the total charge). FYI: you can only buy Dry Tortugas t-shirts at the gift store inside the fort,so you might want to think about picking some up. Another FYI: Since my husband and I were unwilling to leave the water, we almost missed out on the lunch buffet :-(",

Tour the prison/walk around the island(its very small)/go swimming and/or snorkeling. Breakfast and lunch are included in the $169 per person price and are nothing special. The crew is great, very helpful and informative. Snorkeling gear is also included and was very good. The snorkeling was much better than I anticipated. We snorkeled with a 5 foot tarpon for a while and saw some great coral/sponges and fish including jellyfish and little cuttlefish or squid. The cost is high but its a once in a lifetime type of thing.",

        "text": "Nice day trip, 2.5 hrs, boat very smooth and we had pretty nice weather. Boat seemed to move quicker than we imagined. Breakfast began shortly after boarding and consisted of cold breakfast, bagels, butter, jam, fruit, lunch meat, coffee, juice, hard boiled eggs, good for cold breakfast and had plenty to eat, wished they would have had toaster for bagels or toast as they aren't too good cold. We were a little disappointed in only having a few hrs on island to explore and snorkel, after a very short tour with the guide of the Fort, we felt we didn't have time enough to even walk all around the fort if we wanted to snorkel and also had to return to the boat before 1pm to eat lunch.. Had hoped to be able to walk all around the fort and in the office there, ran short of time as we wanted to snorkel. Snorkeling not so good outside of the pilings around the fort. Pilings had quite a bit of coral to see and we saw a larger tarpon and Permit fish along with many very small fish. I guess we expected a little more brilliance in the fish and those we did see were very small. A few said they had seen some larger fish. Area around pilings is the best place to see anything. It's approx. 5-9 ft would recommend that inexperienced swimmers use a vest provided by boat to help keep them above water. Waves kept bouncing us back and forth around pilings so it was hard to get good underwater pictures and hard not to get pushed into the pilings at times. The guide was fairly fast on tour of the fort, however they do not go around the entire fort and if you want to explore the fort you must do so within the few remaining hours. We left feeling we did not get to see all of the fort, it's shop, etc. Arrived island approx. 10:30, obtained snorkel gear and then guided tour of fort, this all took almost 1 hour so approx. 11:30 we felt we had better eat before snorkeling so we wouldn't have to rush back before 1pm. If you didn't eat by 1pm there was no food later. Good decision to eat right after tour as bulk of the crowd returned to eat approx. 12pm. Longer line to get food, fewer tables, etc. After lunch felt we only had approx. 2 hours to snorkel or explore as had to turn in snorkel equipment, change clothes, board by 2:30. We enjoyed the trip and would recommend it to others. Staff on boat were helpful and all very cordial. If I had to do again, not sure if I'd go again, but if so I may opt for the Sea Plane as it is only about $100 more and may provide more time on the island and believe it would be beautiful to see from the air. Lunch was also good, cold sandwiches, fruit, chips, cookies, salads, etc. Plenty to eat with decent variety of meats, drinks, etc. Wish lunch could be served on return trip to not eat into time on island. All personnel were very helpful, cordial, etc. On return trip they sell drinks, cocktails, frozen drinks, beer, some snacks but all to be paid for to include soda and water. Frozen drinks about $7. Bring change of clothes if you want, dressing rooms on island and the boat has outdoor showers to rinse off. It was nice to change to dry clothing for ride back. Sun is bright and suggest sunscreen. We enjoyed the trip just wish it was a longer day. We thought it was expensive, but figured that breakfast and lunch would have cost about $15-$20 each meal, snorkel rental, and boat ride, I guess if you look at it that way it is not so bad and it is something you most likely will only do once unless you are fortunate to be able to camp on the island. I think that would have been the best way to see it. If you have the time I would recommend doing a few day camping trip.",

The ferry is operated by the National Park Service -- with the Rangers running the entire operation. You must make reservations in advance in order to get a seat and be at the ferry terminal by 7:15 AM. The ferry leaves by 8:30 AM and you arrive by 10:30 AM. They tell you about the park on the way over and show a snorkeling video. They serve breakfast on the way as well as lunch while you're there. The park rangers will take you on a tour of Fort Jefferson shortly after arrival. Your snorkeling gear is already paid for, so you can skip the tour and go straight to the water if you wish. There is a reef that you need to swim out a little ways to reach. However, if you don't want to swim too far or deal with a current, you can see a lot of fish by swimming along the walls of the fort. The BEST place to see a lot of fish is around the pilings -- you will see more fish there then you will at the reef. I was surrounded by schools of small fish. The store/gift shop is small, but they do sell cheap cameras as well as SD cards (-- I forgot mine). Be sure to wear sunblock! Boat debarks at 2:45 PM and arrives by 5:30 PM.",

The national park is very small consisting of 7 islands and we were allowed to go only in the Garden Key where the Fort Jefferson is located. The fort is massive but unfinished. NPS is trying to restore many breaking walls. We took a tour guided by the Yankee Freedom stuff and it was for an hour. After the fort tour we went for snorkeling in one of the beaches in the island.The water was really calm, beach is beautiful without any pollution. Since very few people manages to travel this far, place was like a tiny dream island. Actually there are ~5 NPS rangers stay permanently in the island. Snorkeling was great particularly near the harbor where ancient iron pillars are located. There war corals, star fishes and schools of fishes consisting of thousands of fish. I must have seen ~100 different kind of fish in the couple of hours I did snorkeling. DTNP is only reachable through Yankee Freedom II (can carry ~200 people) or by sea plane. Yankee freedom cost ~$165/ person and they will take care of the breakfast and lunch. There are nothing in the island except a tiny gift shop where you can buy souvenirs and stamp your National park passport. Overall the trip was from morning 7:30 to evening 5:30.

Because was a bit on the pricey side (you think?) was a bit nervous but then we figured cost was no more than a day at Disney so we made our reservation. Best decision we have made all summer long, the Dry Tortugas were just straight up fabulous! The ship (Yankee Freedom) was uber clean & modern and the staff were super friendly. Breakfast & lunch (both included) were pretty good and served up in an efficient & expedient manner. The morning started at 7:15. We boarded at 7:30 and were on our way at 8am sharp. Breakfast was nothing fancy but substantial enough. Buffet style and included bagels, cream cheese, hard boiled eggs, yogurt, grapes, dry cereal, milk, O.J., coffee and sliced ham. We docked at Fort Jefferson at 10:30. Being as it was Aug 2 and not a cloud in the sky, it was HOT. So we toured the Fort right away. Can't say how the guided tour was, we did the self guided, bringing along the brochure they made available to anyone who wanted it. Took us about 30 minutes and we should have taken longer but it really was hot and frankly we just wanted to hit the water. Considering that we did the \"speedy\" version we still felt we covered enough and got a real feel for how harsh, lonely but at the same time lovely life here in the 1860's was for both the prisoners & soldiers of the Civil War. After our tour we hit the beach for some spectacular off beach snorkeling! Hot & not a cloud in the sky made for perfect visibility! After snorkeling for an hour we reluctantly got out and went back to the ship for lunch. Again buffet style and frankly a bit better than breakfast. Artisian breads, ham, turkey, tuna salad, potato salad, a lovely fruit salad of apples & strawberries, chips, cookies, assortment of drinks/sodas. After reinforcing ourselves with some yum lunch, back to the beach for some more offshore snorkeling we went. We have snorkeled plenty; Grand Cayman, Bahamas, Looe Key and snorkeling, Dry Tortugas is right up there with the best of them! We saw a nurse shark, bahama starfish, sand dollars, queen conch, parrot fish, barracuda and loads of juvenile tropical fish in the grass beds/coral. One of the cool things was swimming with the mullet! Happened twice, we were just surrounded by millions of them and were able to direct fish traffic with our hands, was def a highlight. The reefs are smaller here compared to Looe Key but also shallower so this is excellent for the littles who might not be able to jump off a boat or the beginner snorkeler. At 3:30 and a bit reluctantly we headed back to the boat and by 3:45 we were on our way \"home\" back to KW. At this point snacks and drinks including beer and wine were available for $ so if you were hungry/thirsty you could grab those. This was a trip of a lifetime and we were so thrilled we were able to do it!",

With an 8am flight we had the island to ourselves, since the ferry doesn't arrive til 10:30. We took a self guided tour of Fort Jefferson, climbing the stairs and getting great views from the top. The tour was only about 35 minutes, which gave us plenty of time to snorkel near the beach. The snorkeling was amazing, with clear water and lots of small fish ( mostly near the wall of the fort). There is a$5 per person entrance fee, but other than that, you don't need any other money. What a perfect day!",

From a birding standpoint, seeing the hundreds of nesting Sooty Terns and Brown Noddies was special, and even though it wasn't yet peak migration, there were a fair number of other species including some not seen on the mainland. With an adult fee of $170 it's not cheap, but a bargain for what you get when compared to other day-long activities. The included breakfast is available soon after sailing (hard boiled eggs, cold cuts, cheeses, bagels, fruit, etc.). Lunch is served between 11:00 and 1:00 after docking (fixings for sandwiches, chips, cookies, drinks), and later on the ride back drinks and snacks are for purchase. The ride out on the Yankee Freedom III catamaran can be rough and it certainly was the day I went. Everyone was forewarned and Dramamine was made available for $1 prior to departure and it is best taken before embarking. Still, there were a fair number of passengers who were ill, so plan accordingly. With an afternoon shift in the wind the coming back was easier. The crew is outstanding, and for those not into the birds, Fort Jefferson is something to see with guided tours included. Snorkeling equipment is provided for those inclined to explore the coral reefs. It's easy to see why this is the top-rated Key West attraction.",

It takes about three hours to get there by boat (less by plane, but more $$$) The boat ride out is very relaxing and a fun way to spend time with your friends or family. Snorkeling the clear waters is great, although you may not see a large variety of fish as I believe it depends on the time of year, ocean currents and tides, etc. The fort has an interesting history and is worth the time to explore a little. It's not really inexpensive, but you get a decent breakfast and lunch, which makes the cost for the trip worth it.",

They suggested Dramaminne so most people took but all it did was make everybody fall asleep on the way over so skip it unless you have history of being seasick. Ferry was comfortable and clean. Spent about 5 hours at the park. We toured around ourselves. Some folks did the free tours. Plenty of history, sightseeing, beaches, gift shop,photo ops and picnic table for eating lunch. They provide snorkling equipment with the cost of the ride but the water a little too cool in February. 70 degrees and sunny.Perfect weather for sightseeing.

There are two commercial options on getting there, a ship that serves breakfast and lunch, or the seaplanes. The planes cost more but are worth it if in your budget. They arrive early in the morning before the boat does, thus, the ten plane passengers have the island/fort to themselves. Consider it a half-day excursion by plane, or a full-day trip if taking the boat. The snorkeling is wonderful, both plane and boat provide mask,snorkel and fins...but no personal floatation devices. Consider bringing some form of inflatable, or life jacket that you can fit in your bag. People have drowned, and its a $55,000 life-flight helicopter ride to the nearest hospital.

I respect the struggle those before us have lived and I like to visit and appreciate what others have lived. However this place is different. I mean we arrived, toured the fort of about a half hour (guided tours about 1-1/2 hour I think?) and then said, 'Okay, let's snorkel!\" Yep, life was hard back then, well it basically sucked if you were a prisoner (spoiler alert, the fort was also used as a prison) in paradise that's true, but we were in the middle of paradise and I've seen old forts before. So we ate a great lunch then hit the water. Great snorkeling, (I have a full beard I trim tight but wish I would have gotten it better, my mask leaked) pretty decent beaches and oh my the blue water, breeze and sun! The crew on the boat is fantastic too! IF you read a bit before you get there on the website they lay it all out for you. IF you didn't read before you got there they lay it ALL out for you repeatedly, then they repeat that, and a few more times too, Always in easy to understand and light hearted ways. Jeff was the M.C. tour host ya might say, awesome guy. We were going to go last year but the seas were rough. Jeff really went over what the day was going to be like. There was going to be 6 foot swells, so we backed out per his advise. We were so glad we did as the trip this year was freaking awesome! It is a decent ride out and back 2+ hours one way so be prepared. But you are on a decently fast boat in the middle of the most awesome blue water you could want and they have a bar on the way back.....if you are in hurry don't bother going to KW anyhow you missed the point. Oh yea, TIP THE CREW!!! I'm a working class guy with a enough education to make me dangerous, I work hard for my money these guys do too and living as worker in KW is expensive. We tipped the bartender every round and when the three of us left we put $40.00 in their jar too. Oh yea really good breakfast too, really more food than ya need but that's okay. The check in staff is awesome also, just read up a bit before you go. You are investing and entire day of your trip and a decent amount of cash so so up ready to have a good time. The temps were 75-80 all day. I wore swim trunks and flip flops all day and a tank top, my wife who gets cold easy had a light sweat shirt and was fine. A buddy of mine took a sweatshirt but didn't need it. Take towels for the beach and sunscreen and anything else you want for the beach, but travel light. We were on it about 2 hours.",

There is a parking garage right across the street so no problem with parking ($12 per day). We took our own snorkeling gear but they had gear available if you wanted it. Check in was a piece of cake. We were pleasantly surprised to find out that we would get $10 pp back because we had a National Park Pass.....plus we had a senior discount! The boarding process was easy and the crew member that gave the instructions was great. Once on board, we were given a nice continental breakfast along with coffee and tea. The had fruit and bagels which were delicious. It took us a little over 2 hours to get to Fort Jefferson. We had some commentary along the way which was very interesting. You could sit outside on the top deck or stand on the upper front deck outside. There was also inside seating with AC. From the deck we saw lots of fish jumping, flying fish and sea turtles so it was an interesting ride....also saw other islands and the Mel Fisher treasure hunting boat along the way. Once at Fort Jefferson, we were given instructions for the day and also given an option of a 20 minute or 1.5 hour talk about the fort. We opted for the shorter tour as we wanted to get in the water and start snorkeling. The tour guide was enthusiastic in his presentation and we really enjoyed his talk.....learned a lot about the fort. Then we went back to the boat for lunch---you could either eat aboard or take your food off the boat. We opted to eat in the AC as it was pretty hot out. We had a nice buffet with cold cuts, breads, sandwich fixings, chips, humus, fruit and cookies. The also had sodas and bottled water available. We enjoyed the lunch and had plenty to eat. Then we were off for our snorkeling. We started on the south side and went out to to the buoy border and then went back and snorkeled along the wall and over the the north coaling docks. I saw a large tarpon and there were tropical fish and coral heads but I have to say it wasn't the best snorkeling I've ever done...It was still enjoyable enough though and it was nice that it wasn't crowded. There were fresh water showers to rinse off the salt water on the deck of the boat and there were changing rooms on the dock. We had brought clothes to change into so we wouldn't have to sit in our wet bathing suits on the trip back. We left the island at 2:45 and got back to Key West around 5:15. We all really enjoyed the trip and thought the Yankee Freedom Crew did a great job and they explain why the would build a fort like that 70 miles out in the ocean in case you're wondering!!",

I believe the trail keeps going and going, but if taking the loop, I would suggest taking the steps up to the top of the bluff. The side trail up top to some historic houses (closed in the off season) and the prairie overlook is worth the time. Fairly easy stroll after getting to the top. If you keep going, I think you end up at Fort Ebey, but once you get the past the lagoon down below, that is the time to head down to the beach or turn around and head back. There are no steps and the trail to the beach is practically straight down. Irregardless of how you do it, Ebey's Landing is a great place to enjoy the scenery and get a little history too.

I had read recently that ownership was being transitioned (don\u2019t remember from/to what agency) but found it listed as a National Park. The National Park site says you can follow signs, but I promise you I did not see one sign that pointed me in the direction of Ebey's Landing (I came from the North, over Deception Pass bridge). The driving directions on wta.org did not make any sense either when comparing to maps, so I drove to what looked like a parking lot on the maps (in the north, up by Lake Pondilla). Now that I have been there and found the National State Park site, parking at the very end of Ebey Road would also be a good parking spot in the south (http://www.nps.gov/ebla/planyourvisit/upload/ebeyslandingmap.pdf). My intent was to do a loop hike, but lacking good maps or directions opted for starting at the North parking lot and planned to figure it out from there. I thought if I started in the North, followed the Bluff Trail south until I reached the Fort, I could go inland and loop back. The problem with that is there were no trail maps whatsoever on site and once you got to the actual Fort, the trails were very intermingled and I could have gotten lost pretty easily. I opted to just continue south on the Bluff Trail and then turn around and come back. Now that I look at the National Park pdf map, it looks like a loop is possible, but I'm not sure what trail you'd take to make that happen. If you were to walk from north to south on the Bluff Trail it'd probably be about 4 miles one way, so be sure you're prepared for 8 miles if you don't have a car at each end. Also note the water spigots are abundant around the campground and Fort area, but all turned off. You'll need H20. ",

It's just a lot of farmland surrounding the water. If you want a great view, just drive a little farther north to Deception Pass. But I guess if you like the \"farm\" look, maybe it will be your style. *We are from the Midwest, so farms in general are not exciting to us, especially these...they were not picturesque at this time of year (June).",

        "text": "El Malpais (\"The Badlands\") is a relatively new National Monument that protects a scenic volcanic landscape created 2000-3000 years ago. It's located about 10 miles south of Interstate 40, near Grants, NM. Roads and trail heads are open sunrise-sunset. Admission to this park is FREE. A visitor center for Northwest New Mexico is located at I-40 exit 85 (daily 8am-5pm, exhibits, bookstore, picnic area) and can provide information. There are two main roads that skirt the east and west sides of the monument to access the points of interest. On the west side, Route 53 (I-40 exit 81) provides access to the El Calderon lava flow (restrooms, picnic area, trail, caves), El Malpais Information Center (8:30am-4:30pm daily but Fri-Sun only Dec.-Feb., exhibits, bookstore, picnic area) and Zuni-Acoma trail head (strenuous 7.5 miles one-way over 4 lava beds). Continuing on Rt. 53 west will take you to El Morro National Monument, and eventually to Zuni and Gallup. Or, you can turn off Rt. 53 onto Rt. 42 Chain of Craters Backcountry Byway (unpaved, use 4WD) to see volcanic cinder cones and access the Big Tubes lava flow and lava tube caves (restroom, trail). You must have a free permit to enter any of the caves that are open to the public; inquire at visitor centers or ranger station. Rt. 42 connects to Rt. 117 at the south end of the park. On the east side of the park, Route 117 (I-40 exit 89) provides access to the Ranger Station, Sandstone Bluffs Overlook, La Ventana Natural Arch, The Narrows, and the Lava Falls Area, then connects to US60 (via Rt. 36) at Quemado. When we visited, we only saw the east side of the park so my specific comments pertain to that side. Route 117 is a paved, two-lane road that is in good condition and is well-marked with signage to the points of interest. The Ranger Station is a visitor center with exhibits, picnic area, restrooms, and a small garden with benches and bird feeders. A 1.5 mile nature trail leads up the ridge. The ranger there was outstanding; very friendly, helpful and extremely knowledgeable about El Malpais as well as other NPS units. The Sandstone Bluffs are just south of the Ranger Station and are accessed by a 1 mile dirt and gravel road. When we visited, the road had just been graded and was passable by a low-clearance 2WD vehicle; inquire at the Ranger Station if you have concerns. The bluffs are attractive, interesting formations, and you can see a long distance across the lava beds and walk around on the rocks (watch children closely!). There is a picnic area and restroom. The next attraction on Rt. 117 is La Ventana Arch. You can see it from the road, but there is a parking area and a short dirt trail that leads closer to one of New Mexico's largest natural arches (restroom, picnic area). Further south on Rt. 117 the road passes through \"The Narrows\" where it is bordered by lava flow on one side and 500' sandstone cliffs on the other. The 8-mile Narrows Rim Trail starts at the picnic area (restroom) and leads along the top of the ridge. The last attraction before Rt. 177 exits the south end of the park is the Lava Falls Area. Explore a rugged 1.5 mile trail through a lava flow (restrooms, picnic area). This trail is marked by cairns (stacked rocks); follow carefully and be sure you can see the next cairn before you leave the one you're at. Sturdy boots are recommended for hiking on the lava. General Information: The best time to visit is spring or fall. Summer can be dangerously hot, but be prepared for intense sun exposure any time of year. Camping is available at Joe Skeen Campground on Rt. 177 (10 sites, grills, tables, shade, vault toilets, no water). This is a remote wilderness area and the nearest services are at Grants, NM. There is no food service in the monument so bring your own food and plenty of water. Wheelchair access: The Ranger Station is completely accessible. The Sandstone Bluffs area has designated parking and a restroom, but deep gravel on the road and sand on the trail makes it difficult to venture far (a lot can be seen from the vehicle). La Ventana has designated parking, restroom and a hard-packed dirt trail about 1/4 mile to the arch, though it can be seen from the parking lot. This trail has some grade and a few ruts and patches of deep sand. Closer views of the lava can be seen at The Narrows picnic area, though the Narrows Rim Trail is not accessible. The trail at Lava Falls is not accessible.",

The longer 2 mile trail goes by the same petroglyphs, very old inscriptions, a pool then to the top of the mesa. The nice 2 mile trail is a little steep at times. At the top there are beautiful views of a canyon and surrounding areas not in the canyon. Be careful not to get too close to the edge.

        "text": "The El Morro National Monument is a hidden treasure in New Mexico. In the dessert as you are driving along there are rock outcroppings interspersed throughout that jut out from the ground, yet none can equal El Morro. My husband said that the sheer sandstone cliffs at El Morro reminded me him of the glacial carved rock walls from Yosemite, although they are a totally different color. While visiting El Morro we learned that it had a constant and reliable source of water around the base of it which made it a very popular watering hole. Back in the day of horse and foot travel, El Morro's reliable water source was a Godsend. On El Morro's walls Ancestral Puebloans, Spanish, and American travelers carved their signatures, dates, messages and petroglyphs; ancient graffiti so to speak. The1/2 mile trail to the base of El Morro is paved and handicap accessible and reaches the lovely water pool. The 2 mile loop trail over the top of El Morro is well maintained, well marked and well worth the little extra time it takes to do it. The museum is free and the self-guided tour on the trails is $3.00 per adults, children 16 and under are free. The movie in the museum is a definite must for detailed information as to how, why, and when the ancient graffiti was created. The cliffs of El Morro up against the deep blue sky, and large, puffy white clouds of New Mexico is spectacular and without a doubt worth the 1 hour drive both ways to and from I-40. Make sure to call ahead or check out their website for guided tours, and special events.",

I appreciate its place in the ecosystem and the vastness is impressive, but it just isn't visually appealing. The southern drive is pretty boring and most of the hikes I did were short and unimpressive. The facilities are lacking too. The Flamingo visitor center, for example, seems like it recently went through the apocalypse. Sure a hurricane hit it, but we're talking over a decade ago. The water activities for boaters might be impressive, but for hikers, you might be disappointed. After you've seen a few gators, you've seen them all and then what? I've been to state parks in Florida that I've been more impressed with (such as Payne's Prairie). If you've been to any other national parks, you should know there needs to be a higher standard here and Everglades just does not meet that bar.

While the cost may be a bit steep (approximately $42 per adult), there is not any other way to see large alligators up close and personal.

We had reserved a 2 p.m. tour, but when we arrived there were four spots left on the 1 p.m. tour (which can not be reserved ahead) so we took it. The tram consisted of two cars, with the guide in the front car but an excellent sound system so we heard everything just fine in the second car. Our guide was EXCELLENT. She was just bursting with knowledge and enthusiasm. I was surprised to find out at the end of the tour (1 1/2-2 hours) that she was not employed by the National Park Service but instead worked for tips, and she received many from the travelers on our tour. The Everglades themselves are a treasure that we all need to protect, especially from the invasive (and very large - so glad we didn't actually see one) snakes. Saw lots of alligators and birds.

Check with the park service before you go for a detailed schedule of tours and programs at (719) 748-3253. There are some picnic areas but no food service or camping. Food and lodging are available nearby at the towns of Florissant, Woodland Park, and Cripple Creek. Camping is available at local state parks and national forests. The park is open 8am-6pm in the summer and 9am-5pm the rest of the year. It's located about an hour west of Colorado Springs via US24 west to Florissant, turn south on Teller County 1 for 2 miles (follow signs). Admission is $5/adult (16+) and they accept NPS passes. The Visitor Center has handicapped parking and accessible restrooms. NOTE: The park elevation is 8400', be alert for signs of altitude sickness and drink lots of water. The sun is intense at this altitude; go prepared for exposure and wear a hat, sunscreen and sunglasses. Storms are common on summer afternoons; stay alert and seek shelter from dangerous lightning. Pets are only allowed in the parking lot and picnic area and must be leashed.",

We watched video about the fossils and petrified red woods before we walked around the park. I think it is the best place to start so you know what you are looking at. To make it even more fun for the children, I highly recommend doing the Junior Ranger program which is free. The children have activities to complete while there after which they can earn their junior ranger badge. My kids loved it! The petrified red woods are interesting and the trail was easy. There was a wildfire nearby at our visit so several of the longer trails were closed. Currently they are having a new welcome center built so they are in a trailer, but I would not let that stop you from visiting. It made no difference to us. It is a very nice place to spend an hour or two. They also have a hut outback that opens after 1:00 where you can look at fossils under high powered microscopes which we all enjoyed looking at.

We got there a little late so we missed the fossil education in the Yurt (over at 3pm). All the staff was extremely nice and had alot of information to share. I don't know that it was so much about the fossils but more about the petrified redwoods for us. Be sure to catch one of the ranger's presentations down in the pavillion. They give alot of history about the area and information on what happened to the redwoods. We almost didn't go down to the homestead but the kids forced me and it was worth it. The volunteer did a great job telling us he history of the homestead and pointing out little things that we missed.

        "text": "Do some minimum reading about what happened and how the history of southern Arizona was impacted by misunderstandings that started here. It can be well enjoyed without the preparation, but I'd encourage you to spend a few minutes researching \"Apache Pass\" and the \"Bascom Affair\" so that your walk into the fort can be best appreciated. This is really where the Apaches Wars began. There is a 1.5 mile hike into the fort from the parking lot where you'll find bathrooms. The fort path is an easy grade, well marked trail and you'll pass good historical signage that sketches out the significance of what you are seeing. Be sure to have some water. You'll come upon the ruins of the stage coach station where troops set up a defensive perimeter after attempting to hold the Apache leader Cochise for the kidnapping of a settler's child, an act that had actually been done by another tribe, but no matter, one Indian was as good as another. Members of Cochise's family were held as hostages when the warrior chief escaped. They were later hung in retaliation for the death of hostages held by the Apaches. Its not at all difficult to conjure up in your imagination hundreds of warriors on the ridge side and in the surrounding hillsides, looking down over the valley and its anxious soldiers. This is one of those rare battlefield sites that brings the events readily back to mind because of its uncorrupted condition. No commercial establishments or bill boards or telephone poles to be seen in any direction. My wife and I encountered a mounted ranger who commented that artifacts show up after every heavy rain. The sense of history is heavy and close. Walking to the fort you'll see the post cemetery and the location of a number of grave sites. One marks a medal of honor winner. Another marks a young child of Geronimo's who had been a favorite of the soldiers but died of sickness. The clear \"Apache Spring\" whose water made this site so vital for life still bubbles on. You're advised not to drink the water. The trek to the fort is uphill toward the last quarter mile. The original fort's ruins are to your right as you climb the last leg of the hill and provide a good vantage to look back over the valley trail. The more massive fort that served over decades of the latter years of the 19th century is directly in front of you, and there is a picturesque American flag flying from the flagstaff in the midst of the parade ground that you will spot from the trail. The fort is large and mostly in ruins. A small but appealing visitor center provides a shady spot to sit and drink. It also has first class bathrooms. When you leave, I'd suggest, if you're up to it, hiking back over the ridge trail that begins directly behind the visitor center. Its a steep and demanding initial push to get to the top, but from here you have one of the most impressive views of an Indian Wars landscape that will ever be your fortune to see. You are standing at the top of the Apache positions during the battle and there's a side trail to take you down to their view of the soldiers. If you turn 180 degrees and look east, you can see the flat plains across which came the stage coaches and freight carriers, headed for Apache Pass. The rest of the trail offer a series of switchbacks down to the valley floor and merges with the trail coming from the parking lot. This fort site and its southwest surroundings looks more like a movie location than an actual historic fort, but its authentic, down to the horned toad that stared me down on the trail. I kept listening for a bugle. Enjoy.",

The walk itself was pleasant, there were plenty of stops with interpretation signs and information from our instructor. We saw where the Butterfield stage had its Apache Wells location, and if you looked hard enough you could still make out parts of the stage trail. There\u2019s also the location of the spring which made the location so valuable to first the Apaches, the Butterfield stage and later the cavalry, along with the location of Tom Jeffords Trading Post. The fort itself is in ruins, however there\u2019s still plenty to see. There are interpretations of locations of the original post hospital, armory, housing, etc. There\u2019s a ranger/museum/bookstore bldg. at the fort, once you reach it. The bldg. also has a wraparound porch around the whole bldg. with benches to sit on. From the porch you have a nice view of the old fort, the surrounding mountains, and the hill that you can hike back to your car on. That trail offers a different view of the Battle of Apache Pass.

Beyond the indoor exhibit is a life-size replica of Fort Clatsop, which is very cool and makes you appreciate, if that is even possible, the experiences of the Lewis and Clark expedition. There are miles and miles of trails to enjoy, plenty of benches for resting, and we appreciated the markers identifying local flora. The only thing that we had to overcome outdoors was the pungent smell of horse manure. We visited in April, so we do not know how prevalent this condition is during the rest of the year.

The gift shop is small but has nice items. There is a water filling station at the Visitor's Center. The Visitor's Center did not sell water, so be sure to bring your own water or your water bottle to be filled. Behind the Visitor's Center, there is a short path to a replica of the fort which Lewis and Clark and their men built to live in for the winter that they spent here. We then walked down the path (about 200 yards) to where the Corp of Discovery's canoes landed. It has a little bit of a grade but not too bad. We did not take the trail to the sea. The sign said it was 6.2 miles. There are nice covered picnic areas close to the Visitor's Center. The scenery on the drive into the park area (through Astoria) was beautiful.

We didn't realize that the only way to see the fort is to take a ferry tour that levels every hour. Tickets for ferry are on first come first served bases. They ran out of tickets and we needed to wait for an hour. While waiting we took their nature walk which is a half mile long and a little creepy but beautiful. We seen gourges trees, flowers, plants and huge spiders. The ferry ride and tour was guided by very knowledgeable national park Ranger. You will find out a lot of very interesting information about the fort and its history. We enjoyed climbing through the fort but the opening that leads to the 3rd floor is a little too tight. My husband has a little claustrophobic and added to his issues with heights he had hard time climbing to the top. The tour is 45 minutes total. Kids loved climing and exploring the fort. Also they do have very intresting Jr. Ranger program that keeps kids focused on the fort and the tour. Worth this trip. No enterence fees. Definitely recommend. ",

The history of the fort was very interesting...I learned a lot about its role in US history beyond the War of 1812. Good displays gave us an idea of life for the soldiers there as well. The price is $10 per adult over 16 (my daughter has an Access Pass so it was free for us) but I think it is worth it.

While we were there, we took in the gift shop and the introductory movie that is shown in a small auditorium every half hour or so. The movie was excellent and explained exactly why our national anthem says what it says and the circumstances under which it was written. Every once in a while there's a movement to change our national anthem to something more gentle and peaceful, like \"America the Beautiful,\" but I think it's important to remember that our struggling nation was not only born under fire but grew up under fire and must be willing to fight under fire to sustain itself, because we will always have enemies wishing to defeat us. Because we were in a bit of a rush and because I'd been to Fort McHenry before, we thought that we would return another time to walk around and take in the other aspects of the fort itself, which I highly recommend to all Americans.",

This year, he elected to visit Fort McHenry, a site I have lived near my entire life, but never visited. What an awesome experience! We arrived prior to the gates opening at 9am and were one of the first cars in. The parking is convenient, free, and immediately in front of the visitor's center. The visitor's center was nicely designed with a brief movie and small museum with interactive features that will interest children and adults alike. We took our National Park Passport Book and stamped it and enjoyed the small gift shop as well. From the visitor's center, there is a paved path leading up to the Fort. There are great views of both the Fort and the harbor from the park surrounding the Fort. The park is free and is an popular place for joggers and families to explore. If you want to go into the fort, the price was $10 per person and they give you a sticker to wear. If you have never been, I would highly recommend going into the fort and getting there in time for the flag raising. The Park Rangers encourage visitor participation in raising the flag. It is a pretty awesome experience to be park of American history in that way. We did not bring a picnic lunch, but you could and it would be very nice. The Fort is about a mile's walk from some good local restaurants. If you plan to do an Inner Harbor Cruise, you can also catch it from the dock there. It was a really amazing experience. Shortly after our visit, we were at a ball game and hearing our National Anthem had an entirely new meaning to me. Thanks to this visit, I am able to appreciate it even more!",

There was no charge for accessing the park, but there is a small fee for touring the actual fort buildings, which include historical artifacts, and audio/visual explanations of fort life, history, and battles fought. This fort played a key role in repelling the British during the war of 1812. I learned a lot from my visit.

Don't miss the video at the visitor's center- there is an emotional surprise ending that is quite memorable. The park ranger walked us from the center to the fort, and filled us in with a great deal of information- much of which I did not know. The greatest surprise? President Lincoln suspended habeas corpus during the civil war, and many of Baltimore's greatest men were imprisoned at the fort - legislators (so they could not sign a bill of secession) and other leaders who refused to sign a loyalty oath to the union. One of them was a newspaper editor- the grandson of Francis Scott Key!

He noted I was over 65 and convinced me to shell out $10 to be able to get in free to any U.S. national park--and so I did. The visitors center has a great video production and really good displays that give you a good sense of how The Star Spangled Banner came to be--and what Francis Scott Keys must have seen during the battle in the War of 1812. But what caught me by surprise was that as the video ended with the national anthem starting to play, the screen went up and we found ourselves looking at the current flag flying over the fort. It was pretty awesome--and whether you stand when you hear it or kneel, you realize that the anthem and the flag have great importance for us as Americans and stand for so much.

A short movie at the visitor center about star spangle banner is very good and its free. I enjoyed learning about the war of 1812. The grounds around the fort are well maintained with many trees where one can find shade on a hot summer day. The young kids in our party had a great time running around and seeing all the cannons on display.",

It was not crowded at all. The entrance fee was $10 per adult and the kids under 12 were free. The park did not have an official tour, but because our group was small enough, the Park Rangers decided to give us an impromptu tour. The kids did the junior ranger activities, which gave them historical insights to the fort, the flag, Civil War era, and Francis Scott Key. We also got to participate in the flag exchange. The kids loved seeing how big the American flag was up close. The views around the harbor look gorgeous. They had a musket and canon demonstration, but they weren't able to fire it at the time of our visit. The crowds got bigger around 11a.m., but overall we enjoyed our stop at the Fort.",

Once you walk into the visitor center you are greeted by a friendly park ranger. Admission was $10 per person and worth every penny. Once you pay there is a tiny museum and an amazing video to give you a better historical perspective as to what happened at the fort. The video will give you chills! Once the video concludes take some time to explore the grounds around the fort. Inside the fort you will be able to go into different buildings to learn what they were used for and other historical items about the fort. If you are luck enough to be there at dusk you can take part in the changing of the flag. Volunteers are needed to help lower the flag and raise another for the evening.

There is a 9:30 and 4:30 flag change, as well as, at 10:30, 1:30 and 3 PM Ranger lead Flag Talk just outside the Visitor Center. Exhibits include historical and military memorabilia. Electric battle map, restored barracks, commander's and enliste3d men's quarters, guard house and powder magazine storage building are some of the restored areas. The experience has newly interactive exhibits and seasonally it becomes a living history. The living history in the fort occurs on the weekends and the fort McHenry Guard performs drills, and musket and artillery demonstrations. They have a Junior Ranger Program which includes an activity booklet which once completed entitles the child to a Junior Ranger certificate and badge. As an adult it was a learning experience generated by reading information boards, listening to the Ranger led Flag Talk and orientation video. The pamphlets which are available at the ticket desk are also highly informative.

Since schools had opened, there were fewer families touring and no school tours were their either, so moving about the fort was easy. Our group consisted of family members (some of whom are in their 70s). The entire attraction is easy to navigate, with few, if any, stairs to negotiate. We saw several visitors with walkers and/or wheelchairs that seemingly were enjoying themselves. All the Park Rangers we encountered were extremely helpful and thoroughly knowledgeable of the events of the War of 1812 and the origins of the Star Spangled Banner. The visitors center includes a great display in museum format that sets the stage for walking the grounds. There is also a short movie to view in the visitors center. When we were there, the primary theater area was closed for emergency maintenance of the projection system; however, the staff had arranged for an alternative viewing area using a laptop computer and a smaller screen. Consequently, the malfunctions didn't affect our visit in any way. Visitors planning on arriving in the fall of 2015 should be aware that, at the present time, the only restrooms are in the visitors center. The restrooms in the fort itself are being refurbished - I don't know when they are due to re-open. The staffers are very good about letting everyone know about the restroom situation. The cost is $10 per person unless one has a senior citizen pass. I would allow at least 2 hours for a visit, although the time would depend on the touring style of the individual visitor. There is a water taxi service from the Baltimore Inner Harbor, but I am not able to comment on it since we drove to the fort. I recommend that potential visitors check the website (enter web via \"nps.gov\") prior to making the trip to the fort. I also recommend this attraction to all Americans - it is a most meaningful few hours (about 2 hours should do it).",

One of the rangers gave a great talk about the American flag, complete with everyone holding a part of a replica of the giant flag that hung above the fort at the end of the battle when Francis Scott Key wrote what later became our anthem. He had an amusing and informational patter about the flag and the history surrounding it and the fort. The fort itself has a few small rooms that you can enter to learn about what went on there, like the jail, and a few other exhibits concerning the fort's history. The visit would be a bit difficult for someone who had trouble walking, but otherwise is available and worthwhile for the whole family. As this is a National Park, if you are over 60, get a pass that gets you in free to all national parks, along with up to 3 guests; the pass doesn't expire.

This weekend there were also many foreign tall ships visiting in the harbor, which we didn't get to visit. Maybe that was the reason for so much police presence. Anyway, the Blue Angels did a demonstration for us along with air rescue demos by other military craft, but the Angels by far stole the show. I tried to get lots of pics of their many super tight formations with my little \"idiot proof\" camera and I look forward to enlarging them and seeing what I captured.

The fort has been maintained well. The view being on the water is great. There is a path to walk along the water, so you could pack a lunch or snack. We went to do the NPS Junior Ranger program. It was a good book with a good amount of work, but it had 3 different levels for different ages. Fee is $7 per adult (over 16) so it is very reasonable compare to other activities.

Most of the buildings are closed off but they have facts about the fort all around and you get an amazing view from the upper walls!

Very interesting not only in regards to the war of 1812 but the writing of The Star Spangled Banner and the history of the US Flag. Afterwards it's just a short walk to the actual monument. You can walk around the lower fort level and up on the battlement. There are inside exhibits of how things were inside the buildings and plenty of plaques telling you the info.

The cannons still function and they shot one while we were there, Wow! The storyboards bring it all to life and put it into perspective. This was a historic battle and turning point soon after Washington DC fell and was burned. Shows the resiliency of the American spirit and why our great country will never be invaded or taken over! 2014 is the 200th anniversary of this epic battle and there will be a lot of attention and additional exhibits/entertainment throughout the summer wrapping up in September. I don't think I'll brave the huge crowds expected, but would be great to see the British Navy in the harbor and the US Navy and Army standing with their guns at the ready! The entrance fee is well worth the money for history and non-history buffs, $7 per person helps keep these kinds of places open and refurbished. Those who complain are the same people who complain about taxes too, you can't have all of these great historic landmarks for nothing!

The Fort itself is well maintained and some interesting things to see as well as the locations is very beautiful looking out over the harbor and trying to visualize what it must have been like back in 1812. We paid the $7 to tour the inside of the Fort and it was worth it to see things from back in that day plus I feel the money is reinvested in the monument so I will always pay.

The visitor's center is wonderfully done. the museum and artifacts are well presented and educational as well as interesting. We were visiting on a field trip for my 7 yo who is home schooled. The use of multi-sensory exhibits in the museum impressed me and held my daughter's attention while learning. If you do not know about the Junior Ranger program, definitely look into it for any kid who is visiting. It is a great way to teach them some history while \"on a mission.\" Complete the booklet which is FREE (usually there is a nominal cost at other National Parks) and receive a pin and certificate of your accomplishment as a Junior Ranger. The museum is great for adults as well. a wonderful history of the flag and Francis Scott Key as well as interactive exhibits on the anthem. The fort area is massive- could spend all day exploring here - and all the rangers and volunteers we encountered were friendly and knowledgeable. Definitely a place for an all day visit if you are interested in history. For families, restrooms were clean, the gift shop was reasonable (many items for kids under $10), the history well-presented and the staff informed and helpful. Fort McHenry is everything you look for in a national park.

The fort is beautifully restored and films, exhibits and plaques thoroughly and effectively depict the battle in the War of 1812 and the importance of the fort.

As we left, a car was coming in so we stopped farther back from the sign. once the car passed, we made our way through the arch. We were immediately stopped by a park ranger who clearly was parked on the other side of the arch waiting to ticket people. She was not an asset to the park with her surly attitude, and even though my husband hadn't had a ticket for over 20 years, we were issued a federal citation with a total charge of $115.00, being told that they take their stop signs very seriously. Obviously they do...figuring on 10 hours of park operation and 4 citations per hour they are pulling in about $5000.00 a day in stop sign violations. If the entrance was laid out better I wouldn't be so angry but it is very confusing and of course you can fight the ticket, but it costs you more than paying it if you are out of state.

There are plenty of information plaques located in strategic places explaining the battle. There are also cannons and cannon balls still located on the grounds. They ask that you not climb the bunkers but there are paths on top that you can walk. It is a very well-maintained park with lush green grass on the earthworks and beautiful brick paving. They even have motion-detected audio guides that activate when you walk into one of the rooms and gives you a short history of the room. We spent about 2 leisurely hours at the fort.

If you just want to explore the park surrounding the fort, you can do that for free. There is a 20 minutes (I think) video that shows the history of the fort and there are few exhibits too in the Visitor Center. We skipped that and purchased 2 tickets to visit the fort. I am no history buff but I absolutely loved the fort, especially the various barracks, weapons and uniform displays. We were able to spend good 3 hrs. The outdoor area surrounding the fort is a great place to sit and relax. We saw many locals jogging and spending there afternoon in the park.",

Allow enough time; we were there over two hours because we took the time to read the exhibits and watch the videos. One of the best parts: you can actually purchase a flag in the gift shop and have it flown over Fort McHenry. We bought the 15-star flag (like the original star-spangled banner) and they gave us dated, printed certificate and ribbon certifying it had been flown over the fort. They prepared the certificate in the visitor's center while a ranger walked out with us to fly the flag. My husband got to fly the flag himself (with the help of the ranger). This is not something that is widely publicized, so ask in the gift shop. It was an awesome souvenir for $50, one we will display proudly.",

The scale model of the fort in the visitor's center was invaluable in helping understand the battle, the direction of the British attack and where Francis Scott Key was witness to the bombardment. I recommend that you start your tour at the visitor center scale model before heading up to the ramparts and guns. Ft. McHenry was Union occupied throughout the civil war and stood guard over some Confederate POWs and a pro Confederate city of Baltimore. Many civil war cannons are also on display. The fort is a very long walk or a short cab ride from the Inner Harbor. We chose the cab ride. $9 plus tip each way. In addition, a water taxi services Ft McHenry during the warmer months.

I decided to hike the river trail. It's a pretty easy hike. Although there were one or two steep hills and at one point a fallen tree was blocking the trail. I had to climb over it. Pretty good hike through some dense woods. Again, there was no one around this day so was really a nice hike.

We wanted the freedom to be able to stop when ever/where ever we wanted to have lunch as we traveled to Gila Cliff Dwellings. We took 15 out of Silver City starting at 9am. The road was in great condition. There was also very little traffic. Great views. We pulled off at most of the view points that posted. Took lots of photos. There was just a little bit of snow visible on the hill sides at times. We eventually got to the visitor center for the Cliff Dwellings. They showed a short, helpful video of the area and the history story. The rangers behind the desk were very helpful as well. It costs $10 per car to visit the dwellings. You don't pay at the visitor center, you pay right at the parking spot by the dwellings. There is a metal box to put your money in. As we drove from the visitor center to the cliff dwelling parking lot (only a few miles, we decided to pull off at picnic area along the road. They had nice cement picnic tables. With great views of the area. Lovely spot. Birds singing, deep blue skies. Temps were still cool probably around 60. We then drove the rest of the way to dwellings. Park our car and walk up to the small ranger staging area. Payed our 10 dollars and listened to a short talk from the ranger. Guidelines about walking the trails etc. My wife and I then began the walk. Very nice trails to walk on. Sometimes a little steep. We are both mid 50's in age. Decent health. We did not have any problems on the hike to the cliff dwellings. We had took advantage of the ranger lady who was stationed up in the dwellings. She was very knowledgeable and friendly. Greatly increased our overall experience. The whole hike experience took just over and hour and half. But we took our time taking photos. I would highly recommend this site and overall road trip.

The camp fees at the springs are; at this time; $5.00 a night per person, $4.00 per person for a day soak. Check their website for more information. There is small store nearby that sells ice, basic supplies, gifts, and homemade ice cream. This is a nice place to stay and unwind if you are wanting more than a day trip to the Gila Cliff Dwellings.

You drive to the site and a ranger will meet you and talk for 10 minutes and then you can either look around or leave.\" I asked him where we should drive to and he said \"just down the road you came in on.\" Well we drove down that road and there was absolutely nothing.

If you are using a GPS be careful with programming - best results will usually occur if you enter \"Golden Spike National Historic Site\" and watch for signs as you get close. Other entries including \"Promontory\" \"Promontory Point\" \"Corinne Utah\" may not take you to the site itself. Stop by the visitor center for maps and program information. The main presentation of the replica steam locomotives Jupiter from the Central Pacific and the Union Pacific usually occurs around 10am along with a brief ranger led program. This site is on the original roadbed where the rails were joined on May 10, 1869. A museum, movie presentation and gift shop is available at the Visitor's Center as are restrooms. It appeared to be wheelchair accessible, but check with the site first to be sure. They also offer a reenactment of the Golden Spike Ceremony but that schedule varies. There are 2 auto tour roads: a West Grade Auto Tour which follows the Central Pacific Grade and the East Grade Auto tour which follows the Union Pacific Grade. The West Grade road was pretty rough and actually partially closed off due to flooding when I was there in August 2014. I would recommend the East Grade Tour - it is a dirt road but reasonably well maintained and heads back towards Salt Lake City. It is about 3 miles long and passes the Last Cut area and The Chinese Arch, two short hiking trails which children can easily manage. The views out onto The Great Salt Lake flood plain are magnificent. There was a $10.00 per car fee for entry, however if a visitor is 62, a citizen or a permanent resident of the USA that visitor can obtain a \"Golden Age Passport\" for $10.00 which is a LIFETIME Admission permit to almost all Federal recreation areas for no additional entry fees for that visitor and all guests within the private vehicle. I visit a lot of National Parks, Historic Sites, etc. and just show my pass for entry. From Salt Lake City, plan on about half a day: 2 to 3 hours at the site depending on what you do and about 3 hours RT drive time.

The flight was beautiful, and we both got window seats. Note: the views and light in the morning are much nicer on the left side of the aircraft. Once at Grand Canyon airport, we were efficiently shuttled into a huge bus (very roomy, but about 3x bigger than our group of 15 actually needed). The driver was friendly and personable, and even went back to pick up stragglers from our first stop after delivering us to the second one. But, at 45 minutes for each of 2 stops, it was nowhere near enough time at the park. If we had flown back right away after driving back to the airport it would have been one thing, but we were made to wait about an hour and a half before our flight back -- which is time I would rather have spent at the park itself. To top it all off, we found it was the same tour we could have booked through Scenic for about a hundred dollars less; the only reason we booked through this company instead is that they actually explained the plane configuration and guaranteed one of us would get a window seat (Scenic told us it would be totally random whether we would get one or not).",

They require prepayment of bookings, 100%. We paid. We called 24 hours in advance as requested to confirm. We arrived 1/2 hour early at the terminal as requested. We wanted the 9:00 a.m. flight as we were told that this was the best 'light' in the canyon for photography and filming. We wanted the front seat upgrade for the same reason. We paid for the upgrade at the check in desk and were confirmed as having received it. We then waited in the check in area and were issued the 'life vests' and watched the pre flight videos. We were given the little yellow boarding passes. And then we waited. 9:05 a.m. No one called our name. 9:10 a.m. No one called our name. 9:15 a.m. No one called our name. 9:25 a.m. - I went to the check in desk and said \"What is going on?\" Have you forgotten us?\" The front desk man said, \"I don't know you need to ask the folks that issued you the boarding passes.\" We then asked the Indian woman at the boarding pass area what was going on and she said, and I quote, \"Oh, we somehow forgot your family.\" I said, \"Okay, so when do we get to fly?\" She said, \"I will need to check to see when we can get another helicopter for you.\" I called the 800 number and was on hold for ten minutes when we were finally told to board. It was now 9:50 a.m. The front seat upgrade I paid $50 was NOT honored. We were refunded the $50 when we demanded to have this refunded as it was not honored. Bottom line - the ground crew of this company are very disorganized and inefficient. They absolutely do NOT care about your experience being enjoyable. You will pay BIG money to be disappointed. And one has to wonder if they are this disorganized on the front end of the experience, what is going on behind the scenes with the pilots and maintenance of the helicopters. Great ride, too late in the morning for good light. Fun for my kids. But very disorganized and stressful to get on the bird. And the front desk guy is totally unconcerned with your satisfaction.",

First of all, they were very insistant about us getting there a half hour early, yet they kept us waiting an additional 30 minutes with no explanation whatsoever as to what the hold up was. The pilot was not informative at all and just played a tape that explained everything. The views were good but I thought we would be dropped into the canyon or at least get closer to the river.

It was the second week of September! We were so disappointed not to share that river trip! Feeling like this vacation was \u2018on the ropes\u2019, I went to the visitors center at Colter Bay and met a native artist named DG House! After a wonderful tour of her incredible art, did I mention her famous blue bears? We had a delightful conversation! She said how lucky we were to see the Tetons in the snow! Most visitors to the park never see the park that way! I felt suddenly so fortunate! She was so right! The next day we went on a very cold exhilarating boat ride across Jackson Lake to the foot of the Grand Teton. We were told again how only a small % of visitors to see the mountains this up close and personal! The snow made our visit so memorable. Also the animals are easier to see!

The river was beautiful, Jackson Lake was gorgeous! We did not see animals as we were there when it was overcast and too cold. I highly suggest the Plains and Panorama loop that last 1.5 hours, but you see a LOT! Pick up a map and follow the loop. Highlight for me was the Chapel of the Transfiguration located at the Jackson end of the loop. Very spiritual and beautiful frame of the Grand Tetons at the pulpit. Ate at Sheffields Restaurant at John D Rockefeller Memorial Parkway at Flagg Ranch. They had the best food we ate our entire week trip. They close at 2:30 for a break before reopening at dinner.

Some of the roads around Moose,Wyoming are only open in the summer with good reason- we thought our mini-van may fall apart on the rocks and bumps. They had a sign up that they were going to be fixing the roads and that road closures were coming. If you are looking for a moose, Grand Teton is the place. We were told by a ranger that years ago during a wildfire in Yellowstone - the moose all migrated to the Grand Tetons and never returned North. We were lucky enough to see a bull on those back bumpy roads near Moose, WY. The Jenny Lake Visitor Center is under construction - it was very crowded while we were there. If you are looking to rent a boat on any of the lakes - there is a 2 hours minimum for all boats including kayaks. Kayak rental is about $22 and hour. Be sure to go to the dam area ... that is were you can take those great mountain pics. Definitely a national park that needs to be on your list of places to see!",

        "text": "Grand Teton National Park is one of the smaller parks in the park system, but it is one of the most recognizable in the world. Checking in at about 480 square miles it is a little larger than Rocky Mountain National Park (415), but tiny compared to its neighbor, Yellowstone (3,462). What makes Teton such an attractive destination is the amazing scenery that is so accessible. And Wyoming has done an excellent job creating an infrastructure around the park that is cowboy rustic with the availability of all the luxury any one could possibly want. I can safely say that you can go into any restaurant wearing just about anything you want and fit right in. You are accepted for who you are and how you like to enjoy yourself. Sure, there are limits, good taste and common sense, but I think you know what I mean. There is no \u201cGentlemen must wear a jacket\u201d nonsense. It is casual and relaxed throughout Jackson Hole. So don\u2019t worry about that. I say this because there are some tremendous places to dine in Jackson Hole and the scenery outside the dining room is unlike anything, anywhere else in the world. So, Teton offers everything from slogging through wetlands looking for moose, hanging off rock faces from ropes or your fingers, crashing through rapids, floating through forests, hiking trails, riding horses, flying in helicopters and eating anywhere from a smoky campfire by a lake to 5 star, seven course cuisine in an historic lodge. You name it, you can probably do it. The trick to doing the Tetons right is to learn everything you can about the place, identify what you want to do, learn about that, and then book early. Grand Teton National Park is suffering the same influx of tourists as everywhere else. Cheap gas and an improving economy has more people than ever exploring the national parks. Not quite loving them to death, but certainly making their presence known. So with all the vacationers out there, you want to plan and book way ahead so you don\u2019t have any panic attacks while you are in such a beautiful place. Lodging options are varied. There are many choices to explore including Jenny Lake Lodge ($$$$$$), Jackson Lake Lodge ($$$$$) Signal Mountain ($$$$) and Colter Bay ($$$). There are several camping and RV options within the park too. Outside the park there are hundreds of options from the obscenely expensive to downright economical. My choice, Colter Bay Cabins inside the park on the shores of Jackson Lake. I will say it again, BOOK YOUR LODGING EARLY. One more time: \u201cBOOK EARLY!!!\u201d Dining is another aspect of the trip that you may need to address in advance. If you want to do the fine dining in the Mural Room or Jenny Lake Lodge, book early. Get that out of the way. You will be disappointed if you try to book the day of. Most of the other dining options in Colter Bay and Signal Mountain and even Jackson Lake Lodge are less of a challenge. And check out the chuck wagon breakfasts and dinners where you ride a horse to your dining location or take a boat to a secluded island. Start at the activity desk. There\u2019s even a chuck wagon barbeque at Dornans in Moose as well as a rockin\u2019 pizza joint. So, what is there to do in Teton? If you are at one of the fine lodges, it\u2019s not bad just hanging out in the great rooms relaxing or sitting out on the patio and watch Mother Nature strut her stuff in front of you. Activities are unlimited and you can go to any recreation activity desk and book things to do. All the lodges have brochure stands and you can book your own, or the lodges have their own guides and you can book with the guide. There is hiking that takes you to amazing OMG locations. Some of the hikes involve a ferry ride across Jenny Lake to the trail head. Any hike you take is surrounded by beautiful mountain peaks thrusting up out of the earth as well as dense forests on the lower mountain sides and the beautiful lakes and meadows left over from the glaciers of the last ice age. All you need is a desire to see nature up close and personal and a sturdy pair of footwear. Oh, and carry a can of bear spray. Bears know what the red can means and when they see it, they will usually go the other way. If you get tired or don\u2019t want to walk. Ride a bicycle. Or go for a horseback ride. The float trips are amazing. Some floats are a few hours, others take all day with a picnic in the middle. If you don\u2019t want to float, take a whitewater trip through class 5 rapids. Nasty canyons are nearby. Name your rafting preference, you can find it in Jackson Hole. Teton is also a driving park. You can drive the roads and stop at the dozens and dozens of pullouts to marvel at the scenery. You can drive to the top of Signal Mountain for a panoramic view of the valley. See if you can figure out where Ansel Adams parked his wagon when he took his photo from the Snake River Overlook. You can drive down to the trail that takes you to the beaver ponds at Schwabacher Landing and watch the otters during the day and the beaver at night. You can drive all the roads in the park in less than a day. Don\u2019t forget to drive out the road to Gros Ventre. It is a beautiful valley that is not in the park. There are moose, elk, deer and bison. Well worth the time and miles to see it. Teton is a small park with a big backcountry. If you like expedition hiking, then this is the place for you. You will need to plan early so you can get all your permits and campsites ahead of time, then you strike off into the backcountry for a wilderness adventure. The back country is filled with world class climbing. If you want to try it, there are mountain schools and guides that will take you out and show you the ropes. You will be at altitude and climbing is strenuous, so make sure you are fit for what you want to try. If you are going to go it alone, check the climbing ranch for preparation and permits. If you are a photographer then you are in heaven when you get to Teton. Shoot RAW files as well as JPG. If you don\u2019t know what RAW is, one day you will and you will thank me. The picture taking starts a couple of hours before sunrise and continues well into the night after the sun goes down. There are so many iconic places to take the National Geographic shot that I can\u2019t name them all. If you want to be shown, sign up for a photo expedition with a guide and you will see things most people don\u2019t. Or, you can get out and explore the park and find your own favorite locations. The park has an abundance of fauna and flora. The meadows explode with wild flowers during the spring. Hiking up mountain trails you see flowers all summer long next to the streams and pools. There is a huge variety of trees, so autumn is especially beautiful (Check out the historic barns on Mormon Row in late Septmeber). And the furry animals will be plentiful including bear, deer, elk, moose, bison, coyotes, wolves, ground squirrels, chipmunks and marmots. And there are dozens of birds including owls, hawks, golden and bald eagles, magpies, jays, etc. If you like standing around, getting wet and teasing fish, then the lakes, pools, rivers and streams will not disappoint. You can study up on where you want to go or hire a fishing guide. Lures and flies are standard stuff. Lots of people fish below Jackson Lake Dam (because there are a lot of fish there) but get out and explore the other rivers. If you get a good catch, the chef at your lodge will probably cook them for you. Just ask. One day in Teton is not enough. It will just make your realize that you needed more time and will have to come back. I would say two full days is the minimum stay as a survey vacation with some activities (meaning you will come back). And you could stay a week and never get bored. Remember, it is all in the planning. I know that lots of people are concerned about connectivity. Cell service in the park is fairly good, but can get spotty up on the hill. All the lodges have wifi in the great rooms, but probably not in the bed room. So if you need to stay connected, you can do that with a little effort. It\u2019s kind of hard to review Grand Teton National Park just because it is such an amazing place. There is something for everyone and the park and outfitters have made every attempt to make the park as accessible and enjoyable as possible. So plan your trip early and you will not be disappointed.",

        "text": "We had spent the Memorial Day holiday in Yellowstone National Park, which was incredible. We are so very glad that we drove the extra miles to stay at the Grand Teton Lodge and see Lake Jenny as well. The vistas (the Cathedral mountains-7 sisters) are absolutely breathtaking, especially at sunset! They are not to be missed. The boat tour on Lake Jenny is well worth the modest expense. We also hiked the area and enjoyed waterfalls, overlooks, and even a snowball fight. In the area we saw a brown bear, elk, moose, and plenty of buffalo. We did not see any grizzly bears on our trip. Binoculars and a good SLR camera are essential to take all of this in, but my iPad took some great pictures and allowed me to upload them to facebook to share with my friends. Be prepared to get out on foot and climb the hills, a moderate feat, but if you need to be dressed for the elements and climbing moderate terrain. We spent two days at the Grand Teton Lodge. The Wi-Fi was very good. However, we felt, coming from West Yellowstone, that in comparison, the food was expensive and the portions could have been more generous, but, we did not feel as if we were \"ripped off\" since it was only two of us, but I'd be concerned if we had brought our family of five/ The formal dining area was lovely, and we had a wonderful view of the Grand Tetons at sunset, but once again, very expensive. The accommodations at the Lodge were acceptable, they were clean and slept well, but for $225.00, I have had much better rooms. However, on the second day, we had toilet problems as the Lodge had just opened that weekend and toilets had not been used that winter, so their were explosions as clogged toilets were stressed. The maintenance team could not quickly rectify the problem so they suggested that we move. We requested and received another room. The staff was efficient and friendly. The gift shops in the Grand Teton Lodge had some lovely items, it was well stocked. The artwork was well beyond our budget as tourists, but glorious to behold. We had the opportunity to travel into Jackson Hole, WY from this location for a day trip, which was a great deal of fun. We really enjoyed our stay. God's masterpiece is on display in the snow capped Grand Tetons in May-June!",

We arranged to eat our breakfast at the hostel (an old ski lodge-from Olympic trials or? .. it seems), and ate dinner we prepared there. Saved alot of money, saw incredible animals, did alot of hiking, went to top of Jackson Hole Ski Resort (a little spendy but well worth it). the Hostel was pretty sparse, it had small bathrooms, the rooms were narrow, dark, with only one window, might be some dust in the corners, no desks or swimming pool here, but they were comfy. It had bunk beds, the floors creak --creaks alot, a large rec room in basement with a large frig for all to keep their groceries (all were labelled) and rec room included a toaster, a microwave, lots of tables and a tv, a ping pong table, and more games that i can imagine, a table just for checkers and chess. OK..it wasn't the Marriott, but neither were the prices. Alot of younger college age kids working at the place, my kids made friends with some at the front desk, and they liked their dog Cinch. I saw quite a few families, and older couples who look like they were in good shape and maybe retired but saving money while visiting the area, also saw plenty of Foreigners who know how to stay in hostels. Grand Teton NP is just up the road from the hostel, as well as Jackson Hole which has a cute historic downtown- our kids did a stagecoach ride, short and sweet for $4/each, and check out the Million Dollar Cowboy Bar, too. We did alot of hiking in Grand Teton, ate lots of PBnJ sandwiches, baby carrots, string cheese, beefsticks, and always brought our own water bottles. Loved this area!!",

A beautiful view all around. The next day, I went over the Paintbrush divide and also summited the peak to the north of the divide. 10820 ft. Great view and easy climb. Then down to Lake Solitude. This area is full of flowers and the lake is wonderful. I continued down and saw the largest moose I have every saw. It had 8 points but another 10-12 points that were about to complete. A sight. The South fork Cascade was fully of waterfalls and cliffs. Going to the end and climbing Hurricane Pass is well worth it to see the perfect view of the 3 Tetons and the valley where the South Fork Trail runs. I stayed two days in this area. Well work it.

There's a small creek you have to cross and I assume at different times of the year it can be wider or deeper. I was here in late October and it was barely an inch deep. Sure it was cold but not so much so that you couldn't walk through it in barefoot. Probably a good idea to bring a towel if you're gonna go barefoot so you can dry your feet if ya wanna put shoes back on. After that it's just a free for all - there's giant mound of sand with various peeks and valleys in front of you so just pick your way and go. Some people bring boards and sleds to ride down the dunes. There's a shop right before you get to the park gates called Oasis where you can rent. I just worked my way up the dunes and ultimately just found a nice quiet spot away from anyone else and just say and enjoyed the view. Of course I couldn't resist taking a tumble down the dunes.

If you plan to sand sled, rent them just outside the park at the Oasis for $20 each, or in Alamosa (a 30 minute drive) for $18 each. But be warned: the trek to the first dune to slide on is about 1/2 mile through rocky sand, and then just sand, and is quite tiring. Sliding is fun but sorta hard to get the hang of it. We spent about 2 hours sledding and were totally exhausted (it was about 75 deg. that day). And the sand starts getting really hot, so you've got to have shoes. I'd suggest tennis shoes or boots, and not Keen-type, which we wore and were sorry. Hiking to the very highest dune you can see from the visitor center yields a view of more dunes, and not far-off landscape. Bring some food and water with you, as there are no food facilities there, or the Oasis has a cafe and supplies.",

There are are areas for off road vehicles, for more exploration of the park. Kite flying, hiking, and sledding down the dunes are options for recreation suggested by the park rangers. Sledding works best during the dry season. We tried using plastic snow sleds with minimal success. Wooden sleds rented by the one store near the park are around 25$ for the day. Our kids used the sleds a couple of times, and then tired of climbing up the dunes. There is a stream(seasonal) that you cross before you get to the dunes that is fun to explore as well. Camping sites are available to reserve. Not sure about RV sites. That being said the park is in the middle of nowhere. There are a couple of options for lodging, a unassuming looking restaurant with decent food and a small store all on the east side of the park. NO wi fi. No close towns with any decent amenities. Fill up gas tank when you can find a gas station. ",

There is a campground / store on the right about a mile before the entrance to the park where you can rent boards and sleds for $20/day. Although you can rent them for a full day, you'll probably only be able to last for half. Try to go as soon as they open (8am) so you can get an early start before the mid-day sun beats down on the dunes. Most people took their shoes off to walk in the sand but then your feet burn like crazy. I kept having to stand on my board to give my feet a break from the 115 degree sand. When you are done riding the dunes, you can lay down in the stream that is near the parking lot. It is really mostly mud, but non-the-less, refreshing after being on the dunes.

Sand is VERY hot. We were there midday - would probably be better early or late. The stream cooled our feet. Bring towels and lots of water. There were people that even brought chairs and shelter, which is probably not a bad idea if you're spending a few hours there. There are outdoor showers to rinse off feet/hair/body parts covered in sand. The sand sticks like crazy! The tallest dunes are tall! I didn't climb them but watching my 16 year old freaked me out!

But we first stopped at the Oasis store, near the park entrance, to rent sand boards. They are 20 dollars a day. We parked at the parking lot passed the visitor center. The creek to the sand dunes are feet away. If you park at the Visitor Center, it will be a good long hike to the dunes. I advise to arrive early has parking gets full by at least 9/10am. If not, come with your patience and you may have to park along the entrance road. We did notice the wind was calmer early in the morning until it picked up a few hours later. Due to the wind (small children) we didn't get to hike further up the dunes but we enjoyed the early sledding. The sand does get hotter further up. We spent most of our time cooling off by walking through the Medrano Creek. It's very cold but warms up as time goes by. We did see people picnic outside their vehicles, but there are at least 4 picnics tables across the parking lot. There are also restrooms and outdoor showers to rinse all the sand off. We spent most of the day there, but we will definitely plan again. The running creek is seasonal, so you will have to plan around that if you want to see it at full. Great visitor center with a gift shop and small museum. No near caf\u00e9 or restaurants so don't forget your food and water during your visit, if not, you will fight for parking when if you return back.",

Even though the standard recommendation is to lower tire pressure through soft-sand spots, this was not an option for us because we did not carry an air-pump.

The rest of the road, which reaches 10,000 feet elevation, was one of the most fun/adventurous drives that we have ever made. We constantly had to set the highest 4WD option and drive 5mph or slower, but the views and experiences were just fantastic. If everything goes well, then this is not-to-miss.

We had assumed the sand dunes would be near where we parked our car but it is a good 0.5 mile walk from the parking lot to the start of the dunes. I knocked down 0.5 points in my rating due to this bringing my overall rating to a 4 out of 5. Once we got to the dunes it was really amazing and we had a blast sliding down the dunes. Walking through the dunes is extremely tiring and we made it across two of them but could see people climbing across many more dunes to greater and greater heights. We were tired after 2 hours and made our way back through the 0.5 miles to the parking lot. On the way out I saw a couple of deers and took some photographs.

        "text": "So, to start my review, I'm issuing a warning...when traveling to the Great Sand Dunes, DO NOT go over the MEDANO PASS if you are not FULLY EQUIPPED to do so. Basically, Jeep or other very high raised 4 wheel drive vehicle is ESSENTIAL to get through sand, rocks, and water. My friends GPS took us this way to get to the Great Sand Dunes. NOT A GOOD IDEA! we had no idea how treacherous it was until it was too late for us to turn around, so do yourself a favor, if you are traveling to the Dunes, take CO 160 from Walsenburg. The Dunes are worth the drive, but NOT over the Medano Pass. Best time to go would be early May, though. The snowmelt will produce a higher level of water to float on. Review the website before visiting for the most up to date info on conditions at the park. We visited in late June and there was only about 3-4 inches of snowmelt to play in. Lower water level was good for the toddler in the group and very refreshing to play in, but the mosquitoes were insane!!! The water is a breeding ground for the stinging pests! Bring repellent and SUNSCREEN! The Dunes get REALLY HOT but are so amazing to see and climb! Bring lots of water, and boots or shoes with high socks are the best ways to keep the hot sand out off of your ankles. ",

Once we started climbing the dunes, we found our trekking poles helpful. The photography was spectacular. On top of High Dune, we captured the beauty of the surrounding area. Unfortunately, due to a long, lingering winter, the upper reaches of Medano Pass Road was closed so we were unable to hike in that area.

The Dunes are beautiful and majestic, an amazing sight to see. I had been several years ago in the middle of the summer, but at this time of the year Medano Creek is flowing adding even more to explore! Several of the boys were interested in sand boarding on the dunes (rented from Sand Dunes Oasis - $20/board/day includes wax). Many of them were quite proficient by the end of the day! Other boys were happy to play \"Dune Soccer\" and still others had a blast playing in the creek. The deepest areas of the creek that we saw was about a foot to a foot and a half, more than enough to play in! The parents had a great time as well. The visitors center is a great place to learn about how the Dunes formed. I would highly recommend this trip to anyone who has not been - and a return trip for those that have! When hiking the dunes be sure to have either closed shoes (hiking boots, sneakers, etc) NOT sandals, or at least a pair of socks. The sand gets VERY HOT. Bring sunscreen, sunglasses, a hat, and a wind breaker. And as a couple of our scouts can tell you....swim trunks and a towel or at least a change of clothes is a good idea in case you decide to play in the creek!",

Driving down the long road that approaches the park only wetted our appetite for the experience with beautiful views of the dunes and surrounding mountains. While we were there, we hiked the trail from the visitors center down to the dunes. Then, through the shallow creek and across the sand flats. Looking upwards, we saw others trudging up the \"Chilkoot Pass\" and decided we wanted to see the view from the top. We hiked up to one of the taller dunes with our 9 year old daughter. It was challenging but the view was incredible. After enjoying the view and catching our breath, we headed back down. My daughter completed all the activities needed to earn her Junior Ranger Badge. While everyone may not be fit enough to hike to the top of the dunes, there is defiantly a lot to see and do at this park for people of all ages and physical abilities.",

We were on the hot dunes by 1:20pm. It was a beautiful site but bring good tennis shoes so you can enjoy the dunes more. I was wearing sandals which were filling with small rocks and hot sand. You can rent boards to surf the dunes for a fee. Don't bring your dogs as the sand is too hot for their paws; unless, you just want to avoid the dunes and stay in the creek. The creek is only about 2 -5 inches deep at most but is fairly cool water. There is a hiking trail closer to the visitors center but we did not check it out. When we left aroun 4pm the mosquitoes at the parking lot were swarming! The area is desolate but beautiful if you like mountains,etc. There is also great camp sites with bear proof trash cans. Plenty of deer tracks were noted in the sand and off road area. The elevation is around 6900-7500 feet and the dunes rise up about 700 feet. The wind is blowing at a pretty good pace so you are going to feel the prevailing winds blasting you with sand. Depending on where you are on the dunes you might feel the wind and sand more. The drive there and back was stunning along US 160. There are gas stations and small town at Fort Garland but not much else so bring a cooler of drinks, sandwiches,etc. We are planning on going back this fall.",

Views on the Newfound Gap Road are not as numerous as on Skyline Drive, but they are great. It's free to get in - you can add a dollar to all your park purchases or join the GSM Association that runs the concessions. Odds are you will see elk, bears, turkeys and more.

A sign said that the trailhead parking was full, but we drove the 1/3 mile to it anyway and did find a parking spot - otherwise, you can leave your car at the Visitor Center and walk to the trail head. By the trailhead there is a small campground and there are restrooms and a water bottle filling station. We did the Devil's Hall Trail which is 4.2 miles total out and back. This is not a strenuous hike, though there are some elevation changes as well as some rock scrambling. We spent 4 hours on this hike, but we take lots of pictures, are not fast hikers, and we found a nice spot to sit and eat lunch during the hike. We passed several other day hikers, but it was not crowded and everyone we met was very friendly. Take plenty of water. There is a lot of shade on this trail and we had a nice breeze. Trailhead is shared with other trails, but the junctions are well marked. Most of this trail follows a gully - this is where the rock scrambling is and in many places there is no clear trail -- just pick the best path through the gully. The trail ends at a slot canyon called Devil's Hall marked with a sign. Return the way you came. While we did not see any, another hiker did warn us that they had seen a rattlesnake. Note that the park is in the Mountain Time zone, but you are so close to Central that your cell phones may display Central time. By the Visitor's Center, we also took the short (0.6 miles) Pinery Trail to the Butterfield Stage Station Ruins. The ruins were two rock walls, so not particularly interesting.

Not much else to offer at the park except hiking. We took a trail from the McKlintock(?) Canyon trail head, past an old homestead, up through pretty boring scenery to a waterfall oasis. That was beautiful, but being the only 2 people on the trail the entire time was creepy, considering the wildlife possibilities. It was long rough hike on rough uneven stones and quite an incline, although it was listed just as a moderate hike. I didn't care for it. People also warned us about driving through the Guadalupe Pass because of strong winds and possibility of flash flooding. We did not go that far, but wanted to pass along the heads up. ",

        "text": "My wife and I visited Guadalupe Mountains National Park two times in 2015. Available at the park are RV campsites, tent campsites, 10 backcountry tent campgrounds, and miles upon miles of hiking trails, most quite well marked. In early May 2015 we camped for one night in the Pine Springs Campground and climbed the trail to Guadalupe Peak the next day. There were quite a few RVs in the RV section of the campground but we easily found a space for our camper. The Guadalupe Mountains official website states there are 19 RV spaces. Restroom facilities, potable water supply, and pay phone are available at the RV campground. Fee is $8.00 per night for RV campers. Fee for hiking in the mountains is $5.00 for a 7 day pass. The trail to Guadalupe Peak is easy to follow. The climb is very strenuous for the first mile and a half. Guadalupe Peak is the high point of Texas (8,749 feet) and the summit is approximately 4.3 miles from the Pine Springs campground. From the summit the views are great as you look out over the floor of the Chihuahuan Desert below to the east, south, and west; to the north you see Shumard Peak and Bush Mountain. At the summit it was quite windy and cool. Numerous people were on the trail either ascending or descending. In November 2015, we camped two nights in the Pine Springs Campground. There were a number of RV campers, but still there were empty spaces available for others. I hiked the Tejas and Bush Mountain Trails on this trip. I hiked up Tejas Trail, which is quite well marked, for approximately 3.6 miles to the junction of the Tejas and Bush Mountain trails and then 2.3 miles to the summit of Bush Mountain, the second highest mountain in Texas. (8,631 feet). Views into Pine Spring Canyon from Tejas Trail at this time of year are spectacular, to say the least. Numerous maple trees in the canyon were blazing red and other trees' leaves were bright yellow. The Bush Mountain trail is not nearly so well maintained. It leads to Bush Mountain--obviously enough--2.3 miles to the west of the junction of trails. Total distance covered in the Bush Mountain hike was slightly under 12 miles. This hike is very strenuous. It was quite windy all of the way--going and returning. I did not see another person all day long. If you like solitude and a very strenuous hike this will fill the bill. Guadalupe Mountains National Park is a great place to visit, but be aware that it is rather remote and the nearest city of any size, Carlsbad, New Mexico is approximately 50 miles distant.",

Haleakala; how beautiful it is, and with its moonscape type setting, you just don't want to miss this. Unfortunately; there is very limited parking, and the National Park Service limits the amount of parking passes during the 3:00am-7:00am time frame. You can schedule this in advance on line; if you're successful, there is $1.50 charge. We were on Maui for ten days; I tried daily, and was unsuccessful (actually, there was one day open, i think it was for the next day, and we already had something scheduled).

We were way above the clouds at over 10,000 ft above sea level. If I went back a second time, I would go for sunset to get a different experience. After the sunrise we spent some time looking around on the summit and then hiked partway into the crater on the sliding sands trail. It's like being on Mars! My only regret it not hiking further into the crater. The Sliding sands trail starts at the visitor center near the summit, so if you park your car up there then you have to hike back up (which we did). What they recommend it parking your car at the bottom visitor center and hitching a ride up to the top visitor center in the morning so you can hike your way all the way down.

If you want to go for the sunrise at the summit, you need this to get into the park. We picked what sounded like the best day for this journey and left our condo in Lahaina at 2:15am. We were there early enough to get one of the parking spots at the top but many cars beat us there. Park Rangers are there to ask you to move if you park anywhere that is not a designated parking spot. We brought warm clothing and even our beach towels to wrap around us. It was cold up there and the wind made it very cold! There is a shelter that you can stand in to get out of the wind and wait for the sunrise. We talked to someone who was up there for the 3rd time. There were clouds on his other two trips so this was the day he got to see all the beauty of the sunrise! It is a long journey and we felt very lucky to have gone on the right day. So much color and it all seems so much closer when you are up there. On the drive back down we saw a rainbow that was also beautiful. If you can handle getting up in the middle of the night, the long drive and the cold you will really enjoy this! We were very happy that we were able to see the sunrise!",

I'd say the first 45 minutes were fairly tame curvy road wise but after that it's all curves and switchbacks. I'm not sure if it was better not to see how close you were to the edge of the road or not! No guard rails. Just pay attention, mind the speed limits and caution signs and you'll be fine. When we arrived, we were probably about the tenth car with plenty of parking spaces available. Took an hour or so nap in the car and woke up to a completely packed lot with people already standing by the rails to get the best view of the sunrise. It was really cold outside (47 degrees with gusty winds) so I viewed the sunset from the inside of the visitor's center. Worth the wait as you see the clouds illuminated by the morning light - brillant. I was told that you could hear chanting/song if you stayed outside. I'm sorry I missed that. Bring a jacket or hoodie to keep you warm. You'll need them. Leaving the park was fairly easy traffic wise. The visitor center does not have snacks or beverages so make sure you bring your own.

A review of the park description will tell you about all the different parts of the volcano and what you see from the lookout.

Tons of people stand at the level of the parking lot so hike up to get away from them. You can also continue on the road to watch from the summit but the view seemed better from the crater edge. We drove up to the Summit afterwards. The fee to get in was $20 but that pass was good for 3 days, we used it again to enter the park on the other side of the mountain near the Seven Sacred Pools. It is cold up there so bring something, my dad just grabbed the comforter off his bed. I wore jeans and a rain jacket and was fine. You are at 10,000 feet so its way colder.

It is a little bit of a wait when you get to the ranger station to pay and it costs $10 per car. There are two different parking areas and places to view. The first one we were told has a lady that tells a story as the sun is rising, but we decided to go the little extra way up to the summit instead. There is a little viewing area that is enclosed and covered to help with the cold. Remember to bring warm clothes with you becuase it is very cold up there.

Then, at 2 PM, we began the drive up to the top in our rented 4 cylinder Bucik Verano. You'll begin in farmland, travel through woods and pastures, before reaching the park entrance ($10 for the car). .The two lane road was in good condition but could have used more guard rails at the shoulders. There are many hairpin turns and most all accommodate more than one car in each direction. Some passengers will get motion sickness, but not as bad as on the road to Hana. The downhill bicycles are the most dangerous part of your adventure.There are many scenic view pullovers to stop at, but until you're well above the clouds, the main reason to stop is to get acclimated to the thinning atmosphere. You may first notice the symptoms at the popular park roadside stop where you can look down into the crater and observe how the mountain can block clouds from proceeding. The final two stops are very close together and the view is what you see from an airplane. You'll be way above the clouds looking down at their tops. Once you make it to the summit, you'll see all the Slversword plants you want. The view is like a Martian or lunarscape. Bare rocky terrain and panoramic views as far as your eyes can see. The temperature in early September was 89 degrees F. at the bottom and 53 degrees at the top. We wore shorts (we're from the northeast) and while it was a bit chilly, it was a welcome relief from the heat and humidity at the bottom. If you have an interest in science or geology,, you'll appreciate all this a bit more. Since most of us are never going to scale Mt. Everest, we can do this and know we saw something unique and memorable. Make sure you have a full tank of gas and bring a sweatshirt, some snacks, and a thermos of hot coffee.

The two areas however, are not connected so will likely require too different days to explore. The summit is great to see the variety of climates/scenery on Maui. It changes dramatically green pastures to panoramas that are more reminiscent of a martian landscape. I would recommend taking some time to explore the sliding sands trail that starts from the upper visitors center. It was amazing! On the Kipahulu coast, definitely take the Pipiwai trail up to see the Waimoku falls and the bamboo forest. This was also a must do in Maui. Once you get down from the hike, take a short hike to the O'heo gulch and cool off and go swimming in the freshwater pools fed by small series of waterfalls. The park has a lot to offer, definitely check it out! Oh, and save your entry receipt because the $10 entry gets you into both sections on different days.",

If you get car sick easily, be sure to make the necessary preparations, because you will get car sick. Once you arrive at the national park and have paid you $10 park admission, drive up to the main parking area and park. You can enter the gift shop and get maps and ask any questions you may have. There are 2 paths, the shorter path leads to the lower pools, and the longer path lead to the 200 foot waterfall and bamboo forest. I strongly suggest taking the longer path first. The lower pools are nice, but the other path is by far the best. Be sure to pack waters. This hike is long and considered difficult by some, so again if you have health issues, be careful. Honestly, as we got about 2/3rds of the way through, I was getting skeptical, even considered stopping. I am so thankful that we didn't. The bamboo forests was like something out of a fairy tale, and then as you walk out of the bamboo forest and continue about 75 yard, you get to see this amazing 200' waterfall. You can walk up to it and stand beneath and feel the exhilaration rain down on your head. It is simply one of the most memorable moments you will ever have. Don't pass up this opportunity. I'm sure that it will not be long before they regulate how close you can get to the bottom of the falls, and I am sure \u00fcit's just a matter of time.

In the historical area there is very limited parking - on Potomac Street, which is one street over on the left as you come down High Street towards the bottom of the hill. But the better way to visit is to pay the $10 per car and go to the National Historical Park where you can take a bus. The park visitors\u2019 center has very little in it, but the folks offer helpful information. The buses leave from there. The bus has 2 stops, one at Bolivar Heights Battlefield, where there are often live displays, firing a cannon, etc. That is where you will learn about the battle itself. Next stop is in town at the bottom of the hill - the historic area. I ride my bike here weekly from Brunswick, MD. I am surprised to see so few people go into some of the exhibits. I think many people wonder if they are open, but if you are there during normal hours they are usually open. Open the door and go in! Admission is free. Many of them are quite interesting. Visit the 1896 St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church that sits up above the historic area. Stone steps lead up to it from High Street and it is beautiful inside - open to the public. Nice view from there. Facing the church, to the right is a road/path that leads another 100 yards to Jefferson Rock. As you walk up, you will actually be on the Appalachian Trail. Back at the bottom, be sure to walk under the train tracks and take a look down the river - a great view. The Potomac is to the left and the Shenandoah joins it from the right. Thereafter, it is the Potomac. A footbridge parallels the railroad tracks were you can get frequent up close views of passing trains as they enter/exit the short tunnel. Across the river to the left there is a hike up the mountain to Maryland Heights. From below, you can see people up there most days. It is about 1 \u00bd mile hike up to the outcrop you see (3 miles round trip). It\u2019s a fairly easy hike, but allow a couple hours round trip. Also, on the far side of the river from Harper\u2019s Ferry, if you turn right you can walk the C&O Tow Path, which at this point is also part of the Appalachian Trail, with close up views of the river. Many people walk \u00bd mile down and back. On the river in the summer you may see hundreds of people on inflated tubes and rafts floating downstream. It's a lot of fun - $29 and up per person. Their location is about 1/4 mile west of the National Historical Park entrance. They will drop you off up the Potomac River and pick you up about 2 miles down the river. In Harper's Ferry, there are several restaurants on High Street and the next street over on Potomac Street. Nothing fancy. For cold drinks and snacks, visit High Street Market, adjacent to Coach House Bar & Grill on High Street. On that same block is True Treats Historic Candy. Worth stopping in and be sure to talk to the owner. She is a historian on Candy and will be glad to share information with you. As you head back to the bus, you might opt to take the path from the point where the rivers meet, to the right and down the steps. It is an alternate path back to the bus with views of the Shenandoah River and a few historical markers.",

Just seeing the old houses and church was awesome enough but the history is a plus. Make sure you visit the John Brown museum & wax museum. I guarantee you'll learn a thing or two. There are a great many gift shops to visit plus several great restaurants and coffee shops. (must try Battlegrounds Coffee. New and delicious!) You do have to pay a $10 to park and enter the park but it is well worth it. And visit Jefferson rock. Small hike up some steps and past the church but well worth it.",

        "text": "Harpers Ferry offers something for many people. It turns into a mini melting pot for the variety of visitors it attracts: history buffs, train enthusiasts, hikers, walkers, outdoor enthusiasts. People of all ages appear to find something appealing about being here. A little planning before arriving does make for a more enjoyable and less stressful visit. As other reviewers have noted, parking and traffic can be an issue during the busy summer season (come in the winter for a different experience). The NPS does a great job in running a fairly efficient shuttle bus system which loops around from the Main visitor center off Hwy 340, to lower Harpers Ferry (in town near the NHP sites), and back to the Main visitor center. It appears that the NPS does not encourage it, but there are two small parking areas besides the Main visitor center: one is at the old train station along Potomac Street; the other lot is about 0.8 miles west of the town center near where Shenandoah Street meets Hwy 340. There is also parking at the Bolivar Heights section part of the NHP. No matter where you park, you are still required to pay the $10 admission fee (per vehicle); there are pay stations at the two aforementioned lots. As is expected, the small lots fill up very quickly during the weekends and on any nice day during tourist season. If you end up parking at the lot on Shenandoah Street, the walk into town is pleasant, level (but on an unpaved trail alongside the road; there are additional \"parallel\" trails on Virginius Island into town), and only took us about 15 minutes. All of Harpers Ferry is a great walker's town, albeit many of the worthwhile points to visit require steep ascents and decsents. So, moderate physical ability is helpful. But much can be enjoyed on the level areas! Walk across the railroad bridge for some great views of the town and rivers. The rail line is active so you may see an Amtrak or freight train. You also may see kayaker and rafters float down either river. The events that occurred here in 1859 put Harpers Ferry into the spotlight. The NPS has done a nice job in recreating the historical atmosphere. There are many hiking trails merging at this point, most notably the AT; Harpers Ferry is the approximate midpoint of the trail and location for the ATC headquarters. If you love to hike and explore, a visit to Harpers Ferry will not disappoint. After your wanderings, there are some small bars, restaurants, and ice cream shops to cool off and relax.",

There is a lot of down hill on maris stone steps at the beginning of the walk so it's not for anyone with problems waking and I wouldn't want to try it when the stones are wet. The town itself is a lot of old buildings from roughly 1870. All are well maintained. There are lovely nature views and walks as well. The NPS does a wonderful job maintaining and presenting it all and their staff members are eager to help. A few things wee closed when we were there. Altogether the NPS part takes maybe half a day but there are also shops and restaurants in town and the Wax Museum ($$). ",

Multiple cars were waiting for parking at the train station, so we followed others down to the end of the street. On both sides of the street cars had driven over the curb and parked on the sidewalks/grass/dirt on the roadside. No one had parking tickets, and there were no clear signs saying you could not park there, so we saw an open space and parked in it. After lunch we came back to everyone (about 30 cars) with parking tickets on their windshield for $50 that must be paid within 48 hours.

Attempting to understand the history on your own is pretty difficult. It is best to take a park ranger tour (free) or hire a guide or do the Ghost Tour the night before. Not all of the buildings are open- but many are and you can go in and see living history at a variety of places such as the sheriff's office, mercantile, etc. There are quaint shops and restaurants in the town as well. Parking is located at the visitor center- with a free shuttle to the lower town or a hiking trail. There is limited parking in the town, train station and one parking lot by the river. There are a number of hiking trails that are breathtaking. Maryland Heights is one of the most challenging- especially if you go all the way to the forts. You can see some of the old lochs from the Ohio Canal.

It's conveniently located off route 340, which is about 2.5 hours away from Washington, DC [45 minutes - 1 hour drive from Leesburg, VA]. Once you are on route 340, you will see the sign of the national park. Following that sign will lead you to the visitor center, parking lot, and some hiking trail. Old Town Harper Ferry is on another side. The admission fee is $10 per car. However, we have America The Beautiful Pass, which is $80 annually and give us an access to 2000+ national parks in US all year round. That saves us much money. ",

We paid the $10 to park in the NP lot, but skipped the bus into town: we hiked the trail instead. It is a more challenging hike, but you go down, when you go into town. Be sure to wear good, sturdy hiking boots or footwear that grips the trails and/or keeps you from slipping on the rock \"steps\" along the way. We saw lots of wildlife: 3 blue herons, several turtles, we think some snake heads, wood ducks, and a yearling. Arrived in town, headed for lunch - then took in many of the historic buildings, complimentary mini-movies, exhibits, and walked across the trestle to see a CSX train literally fly thru the 1931 tunnel for destinations north/west. We took the bus back to our parked car after spending about 4 hours seeing the sights. You can try parking in town for free - it just depends on how many visitors are there, and how close you can get. Seems better to support the park and rest your feet after tackling the cobbled streets. \"3 states, two rivers, and one National Park\" plus three trails converge at Harpers Ferry: the AT, the C&O and the Potomac Heritage National Trail. Try to find the sign painted on Maryland Heights around 1903-06 -- it reads \"Mennen's Borated Talcum Toilet Powder\"! Plus you'll learn that Lewis & Clark started their journey at the Arsenal before heading west~",

        "text": "I just spent three days and two nights exploring Harpers Ferry and it was fantastic. I've been there before as a kid and as an adult with my family, but this trip was solo and a great return to a beautiful and interesting area. I'm mostly interested in natural parks with scenic features and plant/tree life, but Harpers Ferry goes beyond that and offers so much interesting history. From it's beginnings as a ferry crossing to water-powered industrialization, the C&O canal, the Civil War, and the Civil Rights Movement, Harpers Ferry is full of many compelling stories. And they are well interpreted in the Lower Town and throughout the park. I spent my first day exploring Lower Town and all the buildings and museums, plus I walked the Virginius Island - Hall's Island trails along the Shenandoah River. The second day I hiked the Maryland Heights trails and then hiked the Murphy Farm trails. Then on the third day, I hiked the Loundoun Heights trails. The heights are challenging, but so worth the effort. Do bring plenty of water, a hat, and a bandanna since it gets pretty hot in the summer. It can get a little buggy, but no biting insects that I encountered. And some good trail shoes is important since the trails are rocky and with exposed tree roots. I would recommend starting at the Visitor Center located just off Rt 340, about 2 miles from the historic district. It's pretty congested in the historic district on weekends and there's limited parking. It's so nice to just ride the shuttle bus in. On the third day, I did park at the lot off of Shenandoah Street, close to where Rt 340 crosses the Shenandoah River. I was able to pick up the Appalachian Trail crossing from there and proceed to Loudoun Heights. But that was a Tuesday, and I think the lot fills up early on weekends. There is a fee for entering the park, which is $10 per vehicle per day. I went ahead and got an annual pass, which is $30, since I would spend the same amount for the daily fees. And I definitely want to come back. I live about an hour north, so it's an easy trip for me. I highly recommend it.",

The tour guide was knowledgeable, engaging and enthusiastic, but ran on too long. We visited a reconstruction of the firehouse where John Brown holed up with his hostages, a habadasher, a clockmaker, military headquarters, a dry goods store, a pastry shop, a boardinghouse, a gun making shop, an urban archaeology site, a Confederate museum, a museum of Harper's Ferry during the Civil War, an African-American museum and one devoted exclusively to John Brown. The latter had an exhibit devoted to free speech. A photo of a Nazi demonstration in NY during the 1930's was inexplicably mixed in with photos of Civil Rights, abortion, labor, suffragette and anti-war activists. As a Jew, I was both alarmed and offended at this validation and plan to notify my congressman. There is a very extensive book and gift shop with many nice items. The scenery, being at the confluence of the Potomac and the Shendoah Rivers is spectacular, and you can hike along one of the old canal towpaths and see the old railroad tracks.

Thus, it is best to park at the National Park Visitor's Center, pay $10 per car load and take a shuttle bus to lower Harpers Ferry. The shuttle also stops at Bolivar Heights (the site of the second largest surrender of American troops in the history of the United States.) You can experience first hand where John Brown's raid served as a rallying cry for abolitionists and what many historians consider the spark of the Civil War and visit areas where subsequent battles of the War took place. For the more adventurous, you can hike up Maryland Heights (about 1 1/2 hours) to see Harpers Ferry from a high. While the trek can be tiring, the view at the end is worth it. The C&O Canal runs right through Harpers Ferry and provides a gentler hike. Also the Appalachian Trail goes through Harpers Ferry. If Thomas Jefferson thought Harpers Ferry was worth the trip across the Atlantic in the late 1700s, then surely it is worth a visit using more modern transportations means of the 21st century.",

After reading so much and anticipating this visit for so long, one would think it might be a let down once you've gotten there. Not True at all! What a truly captivating, beautiful, compelling, provocative place to be. The park and the town are impeccably kept. It is $10 a car to go about through the tours and shuttles and ranger talks. Everyone that works there is helpful and courteous and mostly all smile. This is a trip I will replicate ASAP. This place is one of a kind that wreaks of compelling history and rich tradition.I do have to say that , for the most part, several of the bar/restaurants have to step it up ALOT.

It was impressive then, and it's even better now, perhaps because the National Park Service administers it. Be aware, I am talking about the historic town of HF, not the spot across the highway when you arrive. You can park at the Visitor's Center and take a shuttle in, but be aware that this will limit you to dining options in the historic town. Prices are high and it's crowded. If you get lucky and find a place to park (there are a couple of lots near The Point), get out and walk down to the spot where the Shenandoah and Potomac Rivers come together. You will see right away why the area changed hands several times during the Civil War. Plus, it's a beautiful view, especially on a bright day. You can walk a short portion of the Appalachian Trail, as the park sits almost exactly in the middle. Cross the footbridge and walk down to the old canal towpath for a close view of the rivers. Believe it or not, skip the stores in favor of The Point and a simple walk through the town. Be aware, though: there are steep hills. ",

The NP fee of $10 is really for the frequent shuttle they provide from their parking area. You don't need to pay anything if you just came in your car and was able to find a parking spot - but note that parking is very, very limited. The shuttle does allow you a good view of the river, canal, and other features on the way to the town. I realized that more time was needed for a complete visit - allow a full day. I was able to see most of the exhibits in the various buildings. It was warm the day I went - there are multiple spots to get ice cream, all in a row! I did visit a few stores but noted that many were closed or spaces were for rent. I was conveniently in the NP bookstore during an afternoon downpour - a very nice collection of books there. Trains rattle by all the time. With the river and canal, one is reminded how important this location was with the Civil War. I hope to visit again.

I probably would not have paid the fee due to the bad weather otherwise. There is a shuttle bus that takes you to the town from the visitor's center off route 340, according to the bus operator it was a 6 minute ride. We only spent about 2 hours in the town itself due to the poor weather and no visibility, and we were really not prepared for the weather, my daughter was very cold. I will definitely return in better weather as the short visit certainly peaked my interest. We did enjoy the small museums in the town and had an early lunch in the business area of town, but unfortunately many of the shops and pubs were closed when we were there right before the holidays.

You can walk through them and along the river. It is scenic and a nice place to stop and break up a drive or enjoy a picnic.

There is limited parking as this is the only lot and it fills up quickly. If you are traveling with dogs then this is the lot you would want. If the lot is full then the alternative is the big lot up at the National Park Entrance a couple of miles away. That lot is quite accommodating with an information center. You pay $10/car which is good for three days. The shuttle leaves every 15mtes and an audio relates history of the place along the way. Sit on the side of the bus doors to have good views of the old canal and all the turtles sunning themselves on the branches. The shuttle will let you off right at the Lower Town. My suggestion is to go into the first building to see the film on Harpers Ferry called \"A Place in Time\".

The hike to look out Rock, which gives you view over Harpers Ferry is a favorite. It is 2.8 miles and lots of ups and downs, although it is mostly flat for walking. Good for all age groups, but you should be in pretty good shape and take water. The overlook, lets you look down on the reg. railroad tracks, and the passenger train track as well as the town. Parking is a rare commodity at Harpers although you can drive through it, but there is no place to park, so it only makes sense to go to the park headquarters to take the shuttle bus.

We got there early (7:30am) to do the Kilauea Iki Trail around the old lava lake (go early to beat the tour buses ). This was really cool. Wear tennis shoes (open toed shoes are not recommended), lava rock grips well but is very jagged. Make sure to do the extra part of the hike through the lava tube! Make sure to do it clockwise and the book for $2 dollars that can be purchased at the beginning of the trail right when you leave the parking lot on the right, was definitely worth the $2. The hike took us 2 hours and we\u2019re pretty fast hikers! After that we headed to the visitor center. We asked about where we could go to see lava.... well usually you can hike up to and around Kilauea Caldera but due to the amount of fumes it is currently expelling it is closed and you can\u2019t go near it. You can also usually go down and see lava flowing right by the water, but recently that has stopped. You can see steam vents and those are neat, but without lava flowing and lots of the park closed we were able to finish all the sights in a 1/2 day. In summary: double and triple check that you can actually view lava before going. Plan on a much shorter day if parts of the park are closed and go early to beat the crowds. Side note- there is very little to do in this part of the island aside from see the parks. The town is tiny and just a handful of restaurants/ a food truck.",

You can walk the 4 miles also for free. At the end of the road you can go down about 100 yards over lava to see the fresh flow into the ocean. It was amazing. What struck me was how quiet people were, just watching nature in action. You can go up towards the pail 1.5 miles over lava to possibly see flows much closer.

Everybody says to go after dark; that's good advice, but unfortunately it didn't work for us. We went to the visitor center first, but the staff, despite their best efforts, was overwhelmed by the crowd, and it was hard to get a good orientation. Since we were hungry we had lunch there, and were very impressed by the quality of the restaurants. We ate at Volcano House across the road from the visitor center, and were astounded by the view of the caldera offered from our table. We decided to drive the Chain of Craters Road to approach the lava flow from the west. It was a nice drive, but ended at a point from which one had to hike ten miles against a strong wind to get to the viewing area. We decided to try again the next day. The following day we approached from Highway 130 from the east. We were told the viewing area didn't open until after 3:00 pm, but this turned out to be inaccurate. At the end of the road, we were able to rent two bikes for about $50 to ride the last 4 miles to the viewing area. The rental company told us they were open from 3:00 am, and that early morning was actually the best time to go. The shuttles don't start running until after 3:00 pm, and perhaps that's what they were talking about. The shuttles will take you close to the viewing area, and you can walk or take your bike on the shuttle to ride from there. We arrived at the viewing area, and we could see the smoke from where the lava entered the ocean, but could barely see the actual glow from the lava. We followed the trail from there onto the hardened lava flow because we were told if we went 40 minutes in, we could get close enough to touch hot lava with a stick. We stayed close to the rope advising visitors not to venture any closer until we came to the point where the trail went up the hill toward vents of steam. We followed that trail for a while until we could smell sulphurous gases and the ground became hot, but we turned back before encountering lava. If I could do it again, I would have continued further up the hill. Instead, we went back and continued to follow the perimeter ropes until we reached the terminus of the road from the west, about a two-hour hike. Had we walked the ten miles from the other side, we would have reached a viewing point which was no better than the one from the east. While it was disappointing not to be able to get a better, closer, view, it was still amazing to hike over miles of congealed lava which looked like someone had emptied a huge bowl of cake batter. It was a day of strenuous activity, so we were happy to be able to get water and hotdogs when we got back to the bike rental area.",

I recommend visiting the Visitor Center for a general overview and geological understanding, Sulphur Banks, Jagger Museum for a view of the famous Kilauea Caldera, Thurston Lava Tube for a quick stroll, and Kilauea Iki Overlook. Have some more time? Do the Kilauea Iki Trail hike--a four mile loop that guides you down into and through a hardened lake of lava. Bring water and wear sneakers! Have an entire day to spend? Do all the above mentioned sites plus the 13-mile Craters Drive where you can stop along the way to look at petroglyphs, crater, view the smoke from the active lava flowing into the ocean, and observe a natural sea arch at the bottom. Have lots of time AND energy? You can hike from the sea arch to observe actual lava but be aware that the journey will be 8 miles round trip.

We hit up the visitor center first so we could lay out where we were going, we listened to one of the rangers give a brief talk and then we watched the videos of the Volcanoes. We had our 9 and 13 year olds with us and wanted to go where they could see the earth in action. We didn't have a lot of time, about 2 hours, and I would say you really should plan on spending at least 3-4 to really explore. We stopped at the steam vents, then the Jagger Museum. It had been raining and cloudy since we left Mauna Kea and we weren't expecting to see too much. But, just as we parked at the Jagger Museum, the sun popped out and it cleared up for a few minutes. We had a glorious view of a full rainbow off to the left and an incredible view of the Kailua crater off to our right, venting steam. It lasted for all of 10 minutes and the rain and clouds came back and you couldn't see anything other than the outline of the crater. We stopped at a few other sites on our way to the lava tubes but couldn't see much. We did the lava tubes (steep walk down and back up, but can do the whole walk to/from the lava tubes in 10-20 mins). By the time we were done there, we were soaked from the rain and called it a day before heading back to Kona via Hilo once again. Kids loved it, we loved it. Highly recommend to see it when you are on the Big Island. ",

        "text": "Well worth spending a few days to explore this very unique national park. If possible, make it at least 3-4 days. There are sights you won't see anywhere else in the world. We arrived just as visitors were gathering for the early afternoon ranger walk. So glad we joined them. It was a very good way to get an intro to the park -- the land, location and info about key features, plants, and the history of the people and their relationship with the volcano fire goddess Pele. Our guide, Education Ranger Michael, grew up nearby, so the national park was his childhood playgrounds. He was very knowledgeable and personable, he pointed out interesting things that we would have missed on our own, and he shared stories about what it's like living with an active volcano. This national park is open 24/7, so you can go to the viewing area in front of the Jaggar Center at night to see the beautiful bubbling, sputtering orange light show of the active Halema'uma'u Crater below. It is said that this is the home of Pele. Check with the visitor center about other lava viewing options. Along the road to the Jaggar Center, there are some places to view the giant Kilauea caldera and some interesting thermal features, such as steam vents. Also, allow a day to drive Chain of Craters Road, which starts near the visitor center and runs down to the sea. Very varied, very scenic. The Thurston Lava Tube is near the start. Once a conduit for lava flows. A very interesting quick stop/walk. There are so many places to check out on the way that we ran out of time before we got to the place at the end of the road where we could walk down to see lava rolling into the sea. But, the views all along the way are \"something else\". We were impressed by the size of the lava \"shields\" (fields) and intrigued by the different forms of lavas. We enjoyed seeing the petroglyphs. The petroglyph trail is .7miles each way. For this and any other hiking, be sure to wear sturdy laced walking shoes, sunscreen and sunhat. Bring plenty of water and a lunch. There is a small \"visitor center\" at the end of the road. We didn't stop there so, sorry, we can't tell you about that. Even if you can't do the final walk, there are some great outlook views along the way. The park is ever-changing because of the active volcano. Be aware of signs warning of places closed/dangerous due to hazards. This is serious stuff. We didn't have time to do any hikes, except for the petroglyph trail, but it looks like there are some great opportunities to see stunning scenery. To take full advantage of the park, we recommend that you go online to check out lodging in nearby Volcano. Also, there is a lodge in the park that overlooks the caldera. We stayed in a darling, very private cottage. The town is small, with limited services, so buy groceries before you get there. We found the book \"Hawaii, the Big Island Revealed\" to be very helpful. The park is open 24/7; there is a nominal entrance fee. It's free if you have the National Park's senior pass. If you're 62+ and don't have the senior pass, ask. Currently, you pay the $10 entrance fee and that pays for the pass which is good for your lifetime.",

We then decided to drive out of the park and west to Rte. 130 south. Arriving at the end of the road on Highway 130, you come to at least a half dozen bike rental companies. Rent a bike from anywhere from $15 to $40. They wereally all a flat rate, no hourly rates. At least one vendor was on site 24 hours a day but our company required the bikes to be back by 8:30pm. You ride 4 miles one way to ground lava flow and to where the lava enters the ocean. At the end of the gravel bike road (and some people walked), we walked another 25 minutes onto old volcanic rock and arrIved at active lava flows. You literally felt the heat.

I wouldn't recommend hiking through the lava fields unless you're in good physical condition. 1-gallon of water per person is highly recommended for the trip. The black lava makes the trek extremely hot. Start early in the morning if you can. At the start of the trail, there are bikes you can rent. There is also a shuttle that takes you 1.5 on the trail, then you can walk or bike the rest of the way. The shuttle was $20 round trip. Bicycle rentals were $25-30. The views are amazing! ",

We then drove down chain of craters road and saw the lava tubes (very cool), the Petroglyphs ( a good walk but not too hard) which were also very cool, and then continued to the west side end of the road. We then drove back to the east side end of the road and rented bikes to ride out to the lava flow into the sea (spectacular). The road is a lot of gravel and not an easy ride but definitely worth the effort. Haggle for a max of $25 per bike and not by the hour. After that we drove back up to Jagger to see the lava spouts in the dark. Again, a real winner. We spent the whole day doing the volcano and did not regret a minute.",

We were staying on the Kona Airport side of the island so it was a 3 hour drive to the park. $20 to enter park and then a 20 miles drive to the end of the road. Then its a 10 mile roundtrip hike. Mile 1 on pavement. Mile 2-4 on loose gravel but straight. Mile 5 on old lava flow which is uneven and full of ankle breaking opportunities. You will be exhausted (we did it at 6pm to avoid sun and see lava at night). The most disappointing thing is that you don't get that close and when you get to the best place to view the lava hitting the ocean, after your grueling 5 mile hike, you have to trip over bicycles from all the tourists who rented a bike from the other side (outside the park) and biked 2 miles in to see the same thing. They had picnics, shared joints, wore flip flops and enjoyed the zen like moment. The hike back is 10 times worse and you won't walk for 2 days. Spend the 2 hours driving around the park and do the bike ride. Or spend $250 per person and get a boat tour. Or spend twice that and do the helicopter tour. If you want to do the hike because that's your thing and you want the patch - bring food and water because the wind dries you out. Bring hiking poles to help with the balance and save some ankle strain. Bring toilet paper. And take all the park warnings seriously. I highly recommend hiking it at night (with a headlamp) to avoid the majority of people and sun. ",

Later that night, we were able to see the lava flow from the starboard side of the ship. Our group spent the entire stop with a private tour guide from Lavaland Hawaii we booked on our own and not through the cruise ship. Vince showed us more of the park and shared so much information and stories, we got so much more out of our visit than if we tried to do it on our own.

The full day was about $90 and included Rainbow Falls, the Hilo Candy Factory, the Mauna Loa macadamia nut farm, visiting a black sand beach, and finishing the day with a swim in thermal pools. It was a very full day and well wrath the price. Our company was Green Travel and Tours. Dexter was our very kind guide. They offer a smaller group at a lower price than booking through your cruise line if you are on a ship.",

Several video's play throughout the day in the auditorium. A great map that includes hiking options is available and can select basis difficulty. Recommend the Lava Tube and Iki Crater trail. However, you can stop at many of them and take in a great panoramic view without the hike. The Sulfur springs are really interesting and easily accessible from the Visitors Center. Driving down the road a few miles to the Jagger Observatory gives you the best view of the overall Kilauea Caldera and the smoking Halemaumau crater. You can see the glow at night but recommend arriving well after sunset to escape the massive crowds since parking is limited. Can be cold, windy, and rainy so recommend appropriate jackets and hat. Saw several unprepared visitors only wrapped in beach towels. Also a small but interesting museum there. Lastly, a drive down Chain of Craters road to the ocean is very cool and you will see a lot of lava landscape, Sea Arch, and historic petroglyphs. Restrooms available at the end of the road.

It's about 420 feet down and then back up - some of it on stairs, some through forest, and the rest across lava beds. This is a perfect hike for families. Lots to keep everyone interested (steam vents, lava formations). Bring LOTS of water if you are hiking. If you're driving Chain of Craters road, allow at least 2 hours. Kids loved these big craters. If you're visiting the Thurston Lava Tube, go late at night when there are no tour buses (bring headlamps or flash lights for access to the tube). This isn't a long but it's large inside. Stay late to see the glow from the eruption site. We couldn't see any lava flowing (none since 2013) but the glow from the \"lake\" in the crater is very cool! Best viewing at the Jagger museum.

If you're a birder there are many indigenous and non-indigenous birds to see, especially at the military camp. We went searching for Nenes, but no luck.

Stopped at Rainbow Falls in Hilo, nice little stroll to the rocks on top of the falls, huge banyan trees, worth the quick stop. Even better, we had an iced coffee at the Rainbow Falls Caf\u00e9 on the way out. The owner is a delightful friendly native Hawaiian, couldn't have been nicer. Her business is new, just a trailer across from the parking lot of the falls. She has iced coffee, great ice cream (coconut!), and is a sweetheart. She only charged me $1.00 for the small iced coffee (I gave her $2!). My husband jokingly asked her what she would do if he didn't have a dollar, and she said \"I would give it to you for free!\"...and I'm pretty sure she meant it. Hard to find people like that!",

We hiked through one of the inactive craters, visited the petroglyphs, drove the devastation trail to the ocean and much more. There were many beautiful plants growing from the lave and many different birds to see in to the forest to include the Nene. Of course you cannot go near the active part of the volcano, but at night you can see the glow from the caldera from the lookouts or from the Volcano Hotel. Looking up from the ocean coast you can see where the massive lava flows from past eruptions have left what looks like giant lava rock water falls. If you expect to see flowing lava and eruptions this is not the place. Pay a ridiculous amount for the helicopter ride and hope the volcano is active. This is a place to breath the fresh air, view a different kind of beauty, smell the flowers, and enjoy the peace and quiet.",

The $15 park entrance is so cheap considering what you can experience. We parked in front of the visitor center and went in to look around for a bit. Asked a few questions of the rangers and began our day-long adventure. We walked across the street to Volcano Hotel and stood along the main Kilauea Caldera. We could see volcanic gas raising out of the Halema'uma'u Crater. After taking some pics we went for a 2 mile walk through the Sulfur Banks and Teh Steam Vents. Awesome display of nature. The smell was very strong and the steam was very hot if too close. Many of the vents were within a foot or two from the walking paths. Many others 10-15 feet away, deep and spewing hot steam. After this 45-60 walk and visit to the area we had some lunch in the covered visitor area. Once lunch was done we filled up our water bottles with rainwater at the visitor center and made our way to the Thurston Lava Tube and and the Kilauea Iki Crater hike. The lava tube was fascinating. A 500 year old tube carved out by hot molten lava that cooled and created a tunnel. The hike through and back was about .8 miles. After we started the trek down 400 feet into the Kilauea Iki Crater. This 1.2 mile hike down a switchback trail was easy going down, motly in shade and cool. Once on the bottom, you stand on the solidified lava down 400 feet in the crater. Words cannot describe the feeling of being so small within the volcano. The crater walk is another mile across and then back and up hill. The entire look is 4 miles. Bring water, power bars, a hot, sunblock and your energy. The entire trip can go 2-3 hours. New life is growing on the lava cracks, beautiful flowers and plants. We took some great pics and the started up the trail. A lot more sweat and water consumed on way up but the switch backs come in handy going up. Even for this Ironman, it is a workout. If you are weak on your feet, a tough climb. Once on top of the 400 ft walk up, a quick break in our cars for AC, water and rest. We drove down a quick minute or two to the Pu'u Pua'i Overlook and Devastation Trail. The Overlook is fascinating as you can see down the 400 ft crater to the lava vents and the small little figures trekking across the lava beds. A little to the left is Devastation Trail, a 1 mile round trip walk. This walk showed us the absolute devastation the lava spewing upwards and forming cones of destruction. Many small bark-stripped trees were scattered a,ong the ground. The ground around us and trowards the cones were very unstable and closed to walking. We stayed on the trail and witessed the destruction and the new life forming all around. Beautiful flowers, plants and chnaged scenery within the forest. We decided to end out day and go to dinner and return a little after 7pm for the site that made the whole day. (We ate at Lava Rock Cafe in Volcano a 10 minute drive - awesome food, a must visit). We went back into the park at 7pm and witnessed something only seen in pics. At night, when the sun is gone, even in rain or fog, the Halema'uma'u Crater, that spews volcanic gases during the day glows red at night, all night, due to the lave bubbling hundreds of feet below. Wow and OMG is best I can say. No other words can explain the beauty of earth changing every second. We closed shop at 7:45 and headed back to Kona - another 2 hour drive back. Tired buy satisfied with our adventure. The day is busy and tough but good food, water and spirits make for an amazing adventure. Even the day after, the entire family talks about the best part of the day - the glowing red gas raising up from hundreds of feet below bubbling lava. What an amazing day. Feeling blessed.",

There are a lot of options for hikes if you are interested, so allow time. There is a very long lava tunnel you can walk through, however I personally feel it has been very commercialized, with lights, cement etc... there are many other natural, less crowed lava tunnels you can visit on the island if you want a different experience.

At this time, however lava is currently not visible in the Halemaumau Crater Unfortunately, the part of the Chain of Craters Road nearest the active flow is closed so for a close view of the Halemaumau Crater, go to the Jaggar Museum where you can see plumes of smoke rising from the bottom of the crater. Take some time to visit the Jaggar Museum and look at the seismographs that are used to measure earthquakes on the Big Island of Hawaii and view the displays. Other major attractions along Crater Rim Drive and the Chain of Craters Road include the Kilauea Iki cinder cone and crater, the Thurston Lava Tube, and the Mauna Ulu eruption site. Along the Chain of Craters Road, there are many large and small craters where over the years numerous eruptions have occurred. Other attractions include the Steam Vents, and Sulphur Banks.

It can be cold in the park, so bring long pants and a jacket in case you need them. Our first visit I had to buy a sweat jacket from the visitors center. Also, you'll want to make sure to go to the observatory right before it closes to read more about the history and to see a fabulous outside view of the crater. We've taken many of the trails in the park - usually one or two each trip, and they are all interesting in their own way. I'd also suggest packing a picnic so that you can sit in one of the areas in the park and enjoy the outdoors. We usually do the park in one day, starting early from Waikoloa, and getting back fairly late, but one day I'd love to stay at the Volcano House for the night -- if only it wasn't so expensive. When I checked it was upwards of $400. Definitely worth checking out if you are able to swing it for the night. If not, it can be done in one long day. Make the time to visit this park -- you'll be glad you did!",

We then drove to the end of this road to the Jagger museum and spent quality time (see my separate review). Then back tracked past park entrance to the lava tube site. There we encountered a very enthusiastic volunteer (Charlene) who was giving an introductory talk and then leading a 3 hour hike down in to the depressed area. She showed photos of the history of recent eruptions and explained how slowly the lava flows are here. There are several guided hikes, and even campsites and a volcano hotel. The area is a very interesting area of contrasts- both lush rain forests and very desolate dry moonscape terrain with steam vents, and cliffs galore.

At the time of our first visit, Kilauea was inactive; since then it erupts regularly, though lava flows are slow-moving, with plenty of time for evacuations if necessary. That day, we saw just steam (no vog--combination of fog and volcanic ash lessen or prevent visibility) coming out of the volcano and had a clear view of the desolate landscape for miles around. I had not remembered how extensive the Park is (admission is $5 per car). Took us quite a while to reach the Visitors Center, which provides a great overview of volcanic activity. This particular volcano is currently the only active volcano in the Hawaiian Islands and has created new land over the years, continuing to make the Big Island the largest of the Hawaiian chain.

You will see a lot and we highly recommend the hikes.",

We had seen it almost 20 years ago, but when taking kids for the first time, we thought it would be great to allow them to see such a unique island. The park did not disappoint. The ranger guided activities were excellent as always, but it's the scenery that makes this so great. It's just a unique and wondrous place. Beauty everywhere. Definitely drive down chain of craters road. One of our favorite activities was to just stop at a random stop and walk along and hang out on the pillow lava rock. Just a great experience. There was no lava flowing when we were there that we could see, but we did return to Jagger museum at dusk where we could see the glow of the lava against the steam of the lava pool- a great way to end the evening. We also had to bypass the lava tubes on our way down to chain of craters because both parking areas were so busy. We caught it on our way up just before dusk and that proved to be a perfect time to stop. Don't forget the park is much cooler than the coast, so bring a jacket or two just in case- we were glad we had. All this for $10 per carload- what a great day!",

Kilauea is in the process of changing dramatically the last few years, and getting some sense of those changes, and what they mean about the power of nature and the smallness of men, and the human spirit--of those who partied before the oncoming lava to their town, and prepared to move if they had to, to the rangers filled with a lifetime's passion for the geology of the volcano to the artists who respond in paint and stone and wood---all of this is worth being a part of.

The path is an easy enough one and not dangerous, with some awesome views. The crater is out of this world - just can't be described - and there was a rainbow there!

What an enjoyable trip, and visiting the Jaggar Museum at night was definitely awe-inspiring. We hiked the Kilauea Iki Crater, the Thurston Lava Tube, and took the Crater Rim drive. Begin at the Visitor's Center, and plan as much as you can. All the maps, the ranger suggestions, and the information booklets are definitely worth the time and effort. Learn as much as you can and enjoy! (The $10 per car entry fee is good for a week, so you can return as frequently as you desire. We ate lunch out of the park, and enjoyed a dinner or two at the nearby Volcano Village.) Some attractions were wheelchair accessible, others not.",

The road to and from has a lot of curves, so if you don\u2019t like to drive curvy roads in the dark (coming back) I wouldn\u2019t do it. We had no problems and still spent 6-7 hours in the park. Make sure you fill up the car before you leave, gas is limited and costly on this road. There is a $10 per car entrance fee into VNP, but we thought it was well worth the money paid. The park is laid out very well and the visitor center is a must stop. The park rangers were very helpful and shared the important places to visit. Here are the stops we made: Visitor Center, Volcano House, Jagger Museum, Steam vents, Thurston Lava Tube, Chain of Craters Road, ending our tour at the Jagger Museum. Plenty of stops along the way to take pictures of the beautiful scenery. The two highlights for us were the walk at the end of chain of craters road (over the lava flow) and the night-time viewing of Kilauea Crater (glowing red lava). While it was a fairly long day (11 hours) from the time we left Kona until we returned it was well worth the trip. Note: we also stopped at South Point and Punaluu County Beach Park (a black sand beach) on the way to VNP, so if you didn\u2019t do that it would only be about 9.5 hours.",

It would be easy to spend the whole day or several days in the park but with a 3 hour trip each way from Kona, we were simply tired of driving. It\u2019s worth a stop at the Visitor\u2019s Center for information and a short movie about Kilauea volcano.

        "text": "One of the main reasons we wanted to visit the big island is to go to Volcano National park. The park has some rally amazing views. The crater rim road is partial closed but still can get to the Jagger Museum and the other side connects with the chain of craters road. If you take the chain of craters road all the way to the end the road stops because of the Lava flows. Along the way there are interesting stops and short walks and hikes. You can get some trails maps at the visitor center. If you can I would recommend that you get your own car so you can do things at your leisure and not be rushed. The island is big and to save a lot of driving I would also recommend staying on the Hilo side a few days the village of Volcano has a number of rentals to stay at. There is a lot to see and you get a sense of old Hawaii and you can eliminate a 3 hour drive just to get to the park. We actually went to the park a couple of days. Over a half day we did the crater rim area and see the sulfur springs, Thurston Lava Tube, devastation trail and the Jagger Museum. The next day we did the chain of craters road. There a number of short hikes we did enjoy the Kilauea Ike Trail which is about 4 miles to complete the loop. At the end of the day we had dinner in Volcano Village and then went back a dusk to see the glow from the Caldera. My kids really did enjoy the park the highlight was to see the glow at night. I think they would have liked to see some real lava flows but that takes a pretty long hike to go to that area a stop at the historic Volcano House is nice and they have a better gift store than the Visitor Center. Also the Volcano Art Gallery is a nice place to stop by and look around. I would recommend a specialty tour for that activity. The other ways to see the lava is to take a helicopter ride or a lava boat tour. If you do a full day trip to the park I would recommend getting cheap Styrofoam cooler at Wal-Mart for $9 so you can put some water, fruit and sandwiches. We picked up some subway sandwiches so we can have lunch in the park without having to leave. Not much to offer in the way for food or snacks in the park unless you pay for an expensive lunch or dinner at the Volcano House. My wife and I were here in the mid nineties and the whole crater rim road was open and the lava flows covered less of the road so we almost drove up to where the lava is entering the ocean. Today it is about a 7 mile hike. If you have time a drive down to Kalapana is cool and you can see the other part of the lava flow which is not in the national park. There are some tour offered from that side and since it is on private land they have the permits to take you to the ocean opening. It is shorter hike from that side. There was something different this time. The fact that the crater rim road was closed because of vog seemed weird since it was not really blowing on the road. I can see if it does but when it doesn't why not open it. The activity today is far less than it was before and the road was open before the government always trying to protect you. Also we noticed there were a lot of rangers milling around and really did not seem to interact with people like they did before. I tried to ask a few questions and I barely got an answer. Even with the changes it is worth a visit and try to plan your day so you can take a short hike or walk so that you get a better sense of the power that the volcano has and how it has shaped the islands.",

We drove down to the ocean, where the lava had crossed the road during a previous eruption. We found this to be a wildly beautiful spot. High cliffs, with the ocean waves crashing off the cliffs. We then drove to Thurston Lava Tube and walked through the forest and then through the tube. Beautiful hike, short, easy to do. Then back to the visitors center to view the volcano. That was a little disappointing, it was drizzling rain, misty, just not much to see.

The tube is well-lit, easy to walk through and pretty impressive to see.

We first stopped at the visitor\u2019s center to pick up maps and trail guides ($2 each and very useful in determining what you are looking at during your hike) and ask about current lava viewing conditions before heading off to the Kilauea Iki trailhead. It\u2019s good to go early while there\u2019s still plenty of parking. I believe we got there around 9am and the lot was about half full. The hike itself is amazing and it was easy to see why it\u2019s the most popular hike in the park. The rainforest makes you feel like you\u2019re in Jurassic Park and walking the still steaming crater floor was like walking on Mars or another barren planet. We were even able to see a couple of nene geese waddling by. The hike is 4 miles long and normally takes 2 to three hours but we finished in 4 hours due to taking a few \u201cdetours\u201d from the official path (not recommended as there's quite a bit of loose rock around). Since it\u2019s a long hike, it\u2019s a good idea to bring plenty of water and snacks, as well as sunscreen as there is very little shade on the crater floor. Near the end of the hike was the trail to the Thurston Lava Tube, basically a large, mostly underground, cavernous passage set amidst a tree fern forest. Because it rained the night before, it was an adventure trying to navigate around the water dripping from the ceiling and the numerous puddles on the floor. All in all, the walk took about 15 to 20 min. We spent more time exploring the rainforest outside the tube than the tube itself.",

A little bit scary, since, after all, it is an active volcano, and could theoretically erupt at any time. Although the seismic measuring instruments would likely give plenty of warning, we were told that in a few instances, form was not followed by the volcano. Apparently the volcano has not read the book! All in all, a very interesting and informative activity in beautiful Hawaii.",

        "text": "This national park is simply amazing. Well, that's my opinion but I was just so impressed! The entrance fee is $10 and that's good for 7 days. Even if you only have one day, the fee is worth it. Start at the visitor center. There you can find out about current activity, ranger talks, get maps of the park and check out the gift shop. I would then take the Crater Rim Drive. This road currently only goes as far as the Jagger Museum due to the activity in Halema'uma'u Crater. Along the road there are several places to stop with great views of the Kilauea Caldera and some short hikes. The other drive is Chain of Craters. The map suggests a driving time of 3 hours and this is pretty accurate if you spend a short amount of time at all the pull offs. The road starts near the visitor center and winds up down at the coast. There are stops at a lava tube, Devastation Trail, petroglyphs, craters, old lava flows and the coast. You can walk to the end of the road where the 2003 lava flow went over. From this side you can also hike the 15 miles to the current flow activity or drive south of Hilo and take a shorter 2 mile hike in the afternoon. There are lots of longer hikes in the park and other roads up Mauna Loa. The thing I liked most about the park was the diversity of the landscape. You have tropical plants and barren lava flows, tall peaks and crashing waves. All this in one national park. There is a small store in the lodge that sells sandwiches and salads, but I would suggest eating in Volcano Village where you get more for the price. It was misty and cool in the park, but the sun peaked out at times and it was sunny and warm down at the end of the Craters Road. Prepare for a variety of weather and don't let it hamper your visit. The mist just adds to the scenery!",

Left from our hotel in Lahaina before 7 am, and 0n a Hawaiian Air plane from Maui by 9 am, in Hilo within 30 minutes, then picked up quickly by Jay our tour guide. From there it is a tour of a candy factory, a 2 & 1/2 mile deep pond, a Japanese Park, Rainbow Falls, then lunch at a not so great country club restaurant, (since we didn't take the tour to eat it wasn't a deal killer). From there we headed on a great drive to the park being enlightened by Jay along the way. He is funny and knowledgeable & made our time on the bus great. The Park is remarkable! You'll hike through a lava tube, over lava flows and fields, past and present. Then to dinner at a not so great park campground... Then to the museum and another hike around the park and explore steam vents. Then nightfall and the show starts with the glow of the lava. It is surreal and hypnotic!

Instead of taking the excursion, it is easy to see the park at your own pace and save a lot of money by renting a car. I simply reserved a rental car from a Hilo airport rental car agency several months ahead of the cruise. When we arrived in Hilo we disembarked and the all the agencies had shuttles right from the cruise ship dock to their location at the nearby Hilo airport. The National Park is about 45 minutes away and easy to find with few turns but for assistance I had brought my GPS from home along. After we were done with our day at the park, we returned to the airport, dropped of the car off and took the shuttle back to the dock. The whole process was surprisingly smooth and simple and the cost of the rental and entrance to the National Park ($10 per car full) for the four of us was about the same as the price for one adult excursion!",

Our first day was typical of the area -- rain, rain, rain, nonstop rain. The locals told me it had been raining nonstop for 5 weeks. We finally got a break from the rain, though, on the second morning, but only for a few hours. If it's raining, go somewhere else. You can't see anything and it is very miserable since at 4000' it's cold, windy, and dreary in the rain (yes, even in Hawaii it can be cold). If the sun does shine, then you can see the caldera, take a few drives to the volcano tubes, or see the main steam vents near the observatory. I heard from others that they had enjoyed their helicopter flyover on a sunny day, and this was something I had wanted to do if we had had the time. The entrance fee is $12.00 per car, but for some reason there's always a wait to get into the park, longer than one might expect. Once you do get up to the gate, the entrance fee is good for about a week, so you keep your receipt.

It was a bit crowded but parking was free because it was a holiday week end. Definitely stop in the visitor center. There is a bathroom in there and we picked up some maps and other information on places we wanted to visit. Bath houses were fun and the kids were fascinated by the hot springs. If you stop in one of the Fordyce Bathhouse there are rangers from the national park who can help you if you want to hike. Since I was with my friends and her kids (one who is only 2) we opted only for the trails that were on a paved surface. Pay attention though. We totally missed the Hot Water Cascade. It is off to the left almost as soon as you pass through the two pillars with Eagles on top. Be careful if you let the kids touch the water because it is HOT. You could even feel the heat radiating off of the water in the summer. I would love to see it in the cooler weather when you see the steam coming off the water. We found a great place to picnic just outside the campground in the National Park. Plenty of shops and treasures up and down Central Avenue. I would also recommend a trip up to the Hot Springs Mountain Tower.",

Admission is free but I got us a boxseat. Went to the Crystal Mine & would have done zipline but chickened out. Some of the days were rainy but we didn't let that stop us & had a wonderful time exploring & remembering \"when.\" Our condos overlooked an inlet of Lake Hamilton & great views of sunsets & rises over Lake Hamilton with balconies to sit on & enjoy these views.

Touring the Fordyce Bath house, which IS the N.P. vis center, was fabulous as we caught a tour from a volunteer which enhanced our self tour. Restoration and history is fascinating. Realizing that these mineral baths were health cures of their time helps one understand a piece of history long gone since invention of penicillin. Charming and fun to spend a whole day on Bathhouse Row and then cross the street to the City area. V.C. desk staff had some very friendly people. The scenic drives are short, and the hikes interesting. The humidity is not enjoyable. Fascinating piece of history w/ gangsters, the wealthy, and the 'old days'.

If you stop by Fordyce Bath House you will find a few National Park Service Volunteers as well as Park Rangers and you can tour the House at your own pace. I highly recommend trying out the elevator at least once, although it does not work as it did back in the davit is still pretty cool. This Bath House has been restored to it's former glory and gives you a glance into the past. I loved this House you can see all the equipment they used, the baths themselves, changing rooms with actual clothing in them, courtyards, music room and even hotel like guest rooms, it is fantastic. A few steps away from that house you will find another 2 Houses that are actual Bath Houses although they are a bit modernized inside you still get the idea and maybe can indulge in a Hot Bath yourself. There is one that is used as a gift shop and you can get your National Park Passport stamped there. I loved this place and regret not partaking in a Bath, oh well maybe next time. FYI the cheapest Bath is $30 at one of the Bath Houses which is pretty economical. You may want to pass on the $7 to go up in the tower as it is not very impressive and does not give you a view of the Bath Houses, do go in the Arlington Hotel it's pretty neat!",

        "text": "So let me say that before I visited Hot Springs National Park, I wasn't sure I'd enjoy it, but I'm glad I did. I think Hot Springs is rather unique in that not so long ago, it was actually still functioning not long ago. Also, it was initially built for profit unlike other National Parks such those that were nature-made. At any rate, when you make it to the downtown Hot Springs area, be sure to park in the free lot--as you exit toward the road, you'll find yourself almost directly in front of the park. You can tour one of the historic bathhouses that has 2 or 3 floors open for touring where you'll see changing areas for men and women, a gymnasium for fitness, and a massage parlor. If you participate in the NPS Passport program, be sure to get your stamp there at the Fordyce House and check out the park store in the Lamar Bathhouse, as they have a stamp there as well. You can purchase souvenirs there such as a embroidered towels, quartz specimens from the Arkansas mountains, and souvenior jugs and jars that you can use to fill with water from the hot springs at one of the nearby filling stations. As you walk the row, you'll notice other buildings that were once bathhouses--some still offer hot baths, while others have been converted to other things. Behind the row of bathhouses, there are areas to hike, and you can see the hot, steaming waters rushing through the aqueducts. Also, there are scenic mountain trails you can drive for those who are interested, though I didn't check any of them out. I really enjoyed this national park more than I thought I would given it's commercial beginnings. If you're in the area, why not check out what once made Hot Springs such a popular tourist destination? This park has no fees for those traveling on a budget. It's right in the heart of town with antique shops, stores, and restaurants, and you can spend as little as an hour or as many as you'd like. :)",

It is one beautiful canyon and quite different from the all so many red rock canyons of the area. It consists of large sandstone (I think) rocks but they are whiteish. Pinon pine and junipers cover the nearby terrain as well as the valley floor. The ruins look really unstable since many are on rock bed which is sliding down the hill. They are still amazing structures to look at. The National Park service has wonderful facilities and drinking water. They have a really nice network of paths which allow you to get up close to the ruins without disturbing them while keeping you safe and giving you the best views of the canyon. Warning.

There wasn't anyone around to ask. We walked over to a little sledding area that was perfect for my little ones to try. After about 5 minutes a man came over and said that the area was closed due to lack of snow and that we would get a $200 fine from the park ranger when he drives by. So, we packed back up and drove further up the mountain. There were two other nice little areas up the mountain we found for sledding but I don't think they are considered part of Hyde Memorial.

The visitor's center had really nice rangers. They answered all of our questions and they gave the kids little Jr. Ranger booklets to fill out while we stood in line. They got a little badge at the end of the tour. There were a couple of people in period costumes and the whole square was very clean and easy to access. My only complaint is that the parking was a bit steep. It cost $20 for just over two hours. There might have been cheaper parking on the street, but we parked just under the visitors center.",

The group size is limited to five people per tour, and it took us about 3 hours 15 minutes, plus clean up, but they allow up to four hours. Cost is $31 per person. You will come out covered in greasy black manganese, so plan to pitch your clothes. Heads up: this tour is not for everyone. You'll need some flexibility and confidence in your body, since you'll be army crawling and chimneying across crevasses and using knotted ropes to ascend inclines and slithering up and down slippery rock faces while lying completely flat on your belly.

Also, other tours better cover the history and geology of the cave; you will see rare formations, and have a real caving experience, but this is mostly about the physical challenge. If you love unique, small-group tours and a little adventure, you'll love this tour! Tips: don't skimp on the pads, get elasticised ones if you can, and don't worry about the chill, you will be working hard enough to be comfortable in a long-sleeve tee.",

There are spotlights inside shining on some of the spectacular parts. The discovery tour keeps you right in the cavern you enter while the guide tells you all about the history of the cave and its discovery. He also passed around samples of limestone, stalagmite?, and another rock piece. When he shines the flashlight on different parts of the cave you can see them shimmer.

I will say it was worth the time spent, about an hour, though you can spend more, I was kind of in a rush. I had missed the longer tours of the day so had to settle for the shorter main chamber tour which gave an overview of how the cave was found and how they excavated it and created the visitor center eventually. If I had the time I would have returned the next day for the longer tour which takes you through several chambers but I had a schedule to keep, sigh. In any case the main chamber still shows many interesting geological examples of how caves form, and the ways the earths geological formations are made. If you give yourself a few hours you could take some short hikes around the visitor center and see the original opening to the cave and some other nice trails that are there, even do a picnic, great for families. The admission prices are quite reasonable, only needed if you do a tour, otherwise the visit is free, you can also make a donation (I threw in an extra $5). There is a small gift shop that has many neat things for the whole family but mostly for young ones, but I think they are the ones who get the most out of these experiences.

Most of our 60 or so age group had no problems (there are frequent breaks where the ranger will point out certain formations) but there was at least one man in our group who was a little too overweight and out of shape to manage the climbs very well--he was panting and sweating by the end--so do be aware of your physical abilities--it you can't do 2 flights of steps at once (and this only happens 1 or 2 times), do yourself a favor and just do the short visit to the great room. That said, there were many others over 60 and maybe even 70 who did fine. The cave itself is really cool--great lighting of the formations (of course they turn off the lights in one spot so you can see what total darkness is), the walkways are Trex with railings, damp in some spots but not wet or slippery like some caves, and the walkways are usually really large and well carved out, so claustrophobic people should not have problems either. And the cave itself is worth it--not many stalagmites or stalactites, it is filled with different cave formations, including a perfect strip of giant cave bacon! We missed Wind Cave, but I'm sure it is also a great site--a lot of people recommend seeing both, and I'm sure you wouldn't be disappointed there either! Please go to at least one of the caves!",

Our guide was Kate who was very interesting and really knew all about the cave. This tour does have a lot of stairs but it's not strenuous. Since we were there in December, we were the only ones on the tour. I really like visiting National Parks during the winter months. They are less crowded and the rangers are more laid back without large crowds to deal with. Being winter, the 49 degrees in the cave was about the same temperature as outside. If you are visiting during the summer you may want to bring along a light jacket.",

Only down side is that tickets must be purchased in person at Jewel Cave. I called from Custer, SD and was told that there were 19 tickets remaining for the last tour, but I needed to head directly to Jewel Cave. They could not hold the tickets or take payment over the phone. We traveled from Custer to Jewel Cave to learn that there were only there remaining tickets when we arrived. We had a party of six and we all wanted to go....That was disappointing!!! The next morning we went there first thing and were able to get tickets no problem.

The scenic tour lasts about 1 1/2 hours and involves walking up and down 723 stair steps over a 1/2 mile loop, equal to about 40 flights of stairs. Some of the stairsteps are steep but overall it's very easy and not strenous. On this tour you'll see two types of calcite crystals, nailhead spar and dogtooth spar, which are the what Jewel Cave is known for. You'll also see formations of boxwork, flowstone, cave popcorn, draperies, stalactites, stalagmites and a long ribbon drapery that our guide referred to as cave bacon.

We've toured the actual Flood Museum in downtown Johnstown, but never knew the actual site of the dam was still accessible for public view. Not only it is accessible, you can walk right out to the edge of where the dam broke! You will need daylight to visit this site. However, there is a Visitor's Center where you can watch a movie about the Club of the Pittsburgh well to do's, and how this tragedy could possibly have been avoided. There is a great view from the Center across the dam and down into the valley where the Clubhouse and some of the summer houses are still standing. The fee, if you're not a National Parks Passport holder is $5 cash or check! What shocked us is that they do not take credit cards at this Center. Which is a bummer because I'm sure it cuts down on the purchasing of their intriguing souvenirs and books! It was close to sunset when we found it, we are going to go back when we're in the area, and have more daylight to explore the dam site.",

There's a good film (if maybe a bit overwrought) you shouldn't miss. The displays in the center are very good. I thought the display showing the progess of the wave by using lights was especially helpful in understanding how quickly and how far the wave traveled. You can see remnants of the dam from the Center so you don't necessarily need to go anywhere but the Center but there are other vantage points around the lake for those wanting a closer look. One thing I was not happy to learn is the park's naturalist has advocated for letting the lake bed grow back vegetation so the valley will eventually look as it did before the dam was built. Apparently, this is the path the Park Service is taking, after years of cutting back brush so visitors can see the extent of the lake. I feel that once the valley has grown back there will be nothing to show visitors other than pictures. What would be the point of the Memorial after that? Why keep funding a Park site commemorating an event if the site no longer looks like it did at the time of the event? So if you're interested in learning about the flood and seeing what's left of the site after the flood you should go sooner rather than later. There is a fee of $8.00 if you enter the Visitor Center.",

Stopped first at the NPS Visitor Center in Joshua Tree to buy our park pass and to get our bearings. I recommend buying your pass here so that you don't have to wait in a long line of cars to buy the pass at the park entrance itself. The Visitor Center has a caf\u00e9 attached that sells box lunches and water (since there are no food or drink facilities in the park) but at $11 each it's pricey. I recommend stopping at the Subway counter at the Valero gas station across the highway and buying your sandwich, munchies, and drinks there instead. Once in the park we stopped at several of the pull-in exhibits along the way, and also walked around the Hidden Valley trail, Keys View, Cholla Cactus Garden, and Cottonwood Springs areas, and spending 4.5 -5 hours in the park itself. The sightseeing was wonderful, and it's interesting to see one desert filled with Joshua trees, and another filled with Cholla cacti right next door. I can see how some may get tired of seeing desert for hours on end, but I very much enjoyed the high desert and mountain scenery, and could just imagine John Wayne or Clint Eastwood riding a horse out in that landscape.

If you're not camping in the park to take in the natural beauty, it's important to plan your route and commit to being there when sunrise hits - it will take you longer than you think. Decide which part of the park you want to be in for sunrise and plan to make it happen. We really wanted to see the part of the park with greater Joshua Tree viewing so we entered the west entrance from highway 62 and Park. The park entrance is unstaffed at that hour (but you'll pay on your way out) and a quick stop by McDonalds and/or Starbucks prior to entering the park will give you the essentials you need to witness the amazing desert transformation as the sun rises. Look at the projected sunrise estimate and plan on entering the park 15 minutes prior to that time to be in a scenic place to capture the moment (Quail Springs, Hidden Valley and Sheep's Pass are all great options). Not only is this an amazing time to see the park, you're first 2 -3 stops in the park will have minimal traffic compared to the volume of traffic over the rest of the day. Early risers are rewarded with a whole different experience. You can spend all day there but if you have kids, it's possible to have a great 4 hour experience before they lose steam and the heat of the day engulfs the desert.",

We enjoyed seeing the Joshua trees, big and small, and the other vegetation of the desert. The various rock formations were nice to see. It's wonderful that these trees and this landscape are being preserved. However compared to the other scenery we encountered on our trip, such as the scenery in and around Palm Springs and San Diego, this scenery was underwhelming. While certainly beautiful, I would not say that the scenery is spectacular, but I would say that about the other areas I mentioned. Also as an example, if you have ever been to Garden of the Gods near Colorado Springs CO, a free city park featuring desert rock formations, cliffs and mountains, you would probably agree that its scenery is much better and much more noteworthy than here at Joshua Tree. I think that maybe this park is best enjoyed by hikers, but we didn't hike. At Joshua Tree I found something that was really fun, but it's something I am not supposed to do! It was the driving that I liked the best. As the driver and the husband, I greatly enjoyed the \"driving experience\" -- my rental car was powerful and handled well. The well-paved and well-designed twisty roads made for great sporty driving in the park. The speed limit is 25 or 35, but I enjoyed 55 a lot more. (Don't tell the police.) I was wishing I had a Porsche, but my rental car was only a Dodge Charger. We stopped the car in the park several times to take photos or look at exhibits. We also stopped into two visitor centers at the park or on the edge of the park. Not surprisingly in such a remote area, you should be aware that you will lose phone contact and internet service for approximately one hour as you drive through. However, on one of our phones, the Google Maps GPS kept working the entire time. As you drive, there are many pullovers with exhibits or signs explaining plants or natural history. There are multiple visitor centers. We suggest that instead of driving through the park for 2 hours, you might prefer to drive in for 20 minutes, turn around, and come back out. The things you will see will be just as good as seeing everything. Glad I visited once.",

This place was amazing though. It is quite large, so be prepared to do alot of driving. Make sure you take plenty of water too because it is hot and there is not much cellphone signal in most of the park. Many areas thoughout the park to pull over, take pictures, explore and hike. We arrived about 2:30pm and stayed till after sunset. The night sky is quite breathtaking, pitch black with just the moonlight and stars, no light pollution from city lights. We went back again the next day, since the $20 per car admission is good for 7 days. Definitely recommend this park!",

I also recommend the Skull Rock hike and the 49 Palms Oasis hike. Get started early if it's going to be hot out and you'll be fine. The park costs $20 for 7 days. If you're going to come back a lot or visit other national parks, get the $80 annual pass. We plan on going back to Joshua Tree time and again. Even if you're just visiting California, take the time to hit up Joshua Tree. There are plenty of places to stay and if you're into camping, there's plenty of that available in the park. ",

They gave us a free park map and pointed out the best places to stop. We picked up some water (only $1 for a large bottle) and headed out on our adventure. The scenery was amazing. Be sure to take some of the short \"day use only\" side roads in order to get close to some of the amazing rock formations. Head down the road to Keys View overlook for a gorgeous view of desert, mountains and valley. We didn't do a great deal of walking in the park because the temperature was 103 degrees. We were somewhat concerned about visiting the park in the heat - would we be able to enjoy it? We found that short stops to get out, walk a little to see the sights, then back to the car for water and air conditioning worked well for us. There were a fair number of large interpretive informational signs at pull offs throughout the park, and I could read the signs without getting out of the car if I chose to. I would love to return during the cooler months and take some of the shorter hikes. But we really enjoyed our visit today. I highly recommend a visit to this park!",

They have visitor's centers at each gate and a lot of the park has paved roads. I would have loved to hike more, but just had back surgery so was limited to doing small walks off of some popular pull of areas. Even those were a LITTLE strenuous, so keep this in mind. I'm also told that trails marked \"moderate\" are really a little more intense than that. We also returned at night to stargaze - I think it would have been amazing if not for the GLARING full moon. It was a wee cloudy, so that's also not great for stargazing. I'm willing to bet winter is the best time to see the Milky Way. But we saw a couple of planets, some popular stars and constellations, clear as day so it was worth it. The 7 year old even saw a shooting star.",

We went when it was 55 degrees (in May) and it started sprinkling, and the wind was blowing so hard I couldn't even open my car door. That was a BUMMER. We went from the 10 freeway up the 62 and entered through the entrance at Park Avenue. We stopped at the visitor center and got a map and advice, and used the restrooms. There is a movie but we tired of it easily. There is affordable water sold there and very beautiful gifts, albeit a little pricey. There is a nice thrift shop next door, in case you need a jacket or just have a desire to browse for some other needed item. I bought a couple koozies to keep our waters cold and a sweatshirt because I was FREEZING! So we started driving through the park and at the first picnic stop, I didn't realize that you could drive around the back and there was a beautiful place to hike and eat and trash cans, etc. I learned that the second time when we went back during better weather. So we drove up to see the view, and it was so cold and windy I was SO HAPPY to get in the car I can't even tell you. So we just drove out of the park, but it takes a couple hours and then you are 30 miles north of where you started. So then we drove to Palm Springs and it took way over an hour to get where we were staying in Cathedral City. When we went back on that Sunday - you purchase a 7 day pass for $15 so why not go back... the park was beautiful. We took photos of trees and rocks and wildflowers and had a really nice time. It was a long drive back to LA that mothers day, but happy we went back. Have previously gone to Keyes Ranch and that was AWESOME. And of course we did take a photo of cap rock. I still don't see it, but apparently everyone else does. The camp sites looked nice but I am NOT a camper! Don't cheat yourself. Allow a full day to enjoy the park.",

We spotted many rock climbers on the top of the huge granite rocks. It was amazing how varied the vegetation was along the trail. My son enjoyed climbing up many of the rocks to get a better view. We also stopped where you can look out across the desert to Palm Springs. The view was stunning. We then stopped at Skull Rock and hiked along the path as well. Give yourself plenty of time to enjoy the park, stop along the route and hike on trails. It takes about 1 1/2 hours to complete the loop, plus add in stops and hiking. We spent about 3.5 hours in the park and didn't do as much as we would have liked due to lack of time. The serenity of the park is refreshing in contrast to our crazy, hectic lives. ",

My husband saw a huge jack rabbit while he was taking a picture of a pretty cactus flower. There are some amazing rock formations besides all of the Joshua Trees and cacti. It is a great change from being around crowds. You can spend a lot of time there but we chose to leave a little early, like 3:30 (arriving there around 10:30am) so that we could get back and finish out last ticket to Disney. We bought a 3 day pass so we already spent a day in each park and now wanted to finish up anything we missed.

The Keys view was awesome. One day is not enough to explore the place. We wanted to go to Keys Ranch tour, but I didn't know that you have to reserve months in advance. So please take note of that. But eventhough, we missed it, we have explored other places of the park. It is too big that you could still do other stuff. There were lots of campgrounds and they were all good.

It was a very busy day, but it really doesn't detract from the beauty and other-worldly atmosphere of,this park. If you are willing to walk a bit, you can easily find parking near the busiest sights. We went on a gorgeous clear day. It was cool and breezy and the blue sky was dramatic as a backdrop to the amazing Joshua trees, boulders, dead wood, and brush we saw. There are no facilities in the park other than pit toilets and picnic benches, so bring plenty of food and water, especially on hot days. There are lots of places for hiking and photos. There were many people rock climbing, and in the town of Joshua Tree there are climbing outfitters. You should probably investigate that aspect before going to the park if you intend to rock climb. We drove to Key point to see the valley. People are constantly pulling in and out, so parking was easy. Great views from the overlook, but it is usually hazy so not great for photos.

Two gallons of water per person per day is the quantity suggested by the park when hiking and exploring.

I recommend you start at the West End Entrance Station after stopping at the Joshua Tree Visitors Center to get a map and advice from the park rangers. From there you can traverse the park as you wish, we exited at the bottom in Cottonwood so cut diagonally thru the place. I suspect many people do this in reverse, like many similar drives it will be a different experience depending on which direction you travel, next time I am there I will go in reverse staring from Cottonwood side. We hiked twice and stopped frequently and still it took us less than 5 hours to cover what we wanted to this visit. You should do the Hidden Valley Hike, Barker Dam hike, you absolutely need to drive up to Keys View for a stunning view of the whole valley. You will also pass \"Skull Rock\" at some point stop to check out this freak of nature! The Cholla Cactus gardens on the way to the Cottonwood Visitor Center is worth a look as well. As they tell you up front there is no food, no water and no gas in the park only restrooms so pack your own goods especially water. We were there in January so cool, in the summer this place is HOT and potentially dangerous so know what you are doing in that heat. Also while the hikes are not too hard physically, they are challenging in places going over rocks and uneven terrain, wear good foot great and if you have physical limitations know what you are getting into before you head off on trail. Even if you never left your car, the beauty is worth the trip. The Joshua Trees themselves are really neat and only found in the northern half of the park. If you have a senior pass to the National Parks you can use it here to avoid the $25 entrance fee.",

We booked our tour of the settlement through the Mule Ride people even though we were not riding the mules because Damien Tours website indicated no tours available in late August (apparently they don't offer tours every day, so the owners of the Mule Ride have started their own tour, because without a tour of the settlement, no one would do the mule ride). Tour was about 3 hours, we were in a van with large windows, affording good visibility) and included a brown bag lunch. Incredible place.

If you hike down the trail be sure to wear good hiking shoes. We also had hiking sticks, purchased at Walmart 2 for $20, which were a life saver. The hike is strenuous, but doable. If the path is wet, as it was on our trip down, the rocks can be very slippery requiring close attention to every step made. Take a rain poncho with you, sure wish I had put one in the backpack. You definitely want to start on the path early, around 7:45, to stay ahead of the mules, and their additional droppings. Once you arrive in Kalaupapa you are struck by the beauty and serenity of the area. The 4 hour tour, provided by Damien Tours, was informative and heartbreaking. Damien's tours has retired the old yellow school bus and replaced it with a new van. The van is very comfortable but the side windows are obstructed which makes it nearly impossible to see anything as you ride. luckily you are in and out of the van at numerous spots. The mule riders had their own bus and tour. We would recommend a trip to Molokai and Kalaupapa to anyone visiting Hawaii. All aspects of this trip have to be planned and booked separately.",

However, one resident has cashed in and in order to view what your tax dollars are funding, you are required to pay $50 in cash to a resident who holds a monopoly on a \"tour\". While the tour is very interesting and could be worth the money, the requirement to pay $50 cash - which ironically is probably being under-reported and NOT being taxed - to enjoy what you are already paying for is very disheartening. I have been to over 100 national parks, historic places, and sites and this one is disgustingly run. Whereas there is certainly a beautiful history to this place, these residents are no longer \"banished\" here and they are being WELL taken care of by the government (our tax dollars are paying over 80 employees to benefit 8 people).

Took the required tour (village of Hansen's disease patients & surrounding area) and were pleasantly surprised with what we learned. Only 4 stars because, first: the ferry leaves before the mule ride or hikers can get back (that's what they say)--so you have to stay over or fly.

It is definitely not the highlight of the park, but you get to see one of the more recent lava flows and some of the local flora. You have two options, take a hike down to the ocean (about a mile each way), or drive down to the beach area. To do this, you leave the park and drive to the Honokohau marina, stay on the right or North side of the marina and drive all the way to where the marina parking area ends. Park there and walk to the marked entrance of the park trail. It is a short walk to the ocean. There is a nice, thin beach with picnic area and a re-created Hawaiian huts. There is a shallow bay here that has good snorkeling and lots of turtles. In fact, the beach to the right along the ocean is full of turtles. Walk along the lava tide pool areas and they are usually eating the algae on the rocks in the water. There is a Hawaiian fish pond about 200 yards along the beach where there is some good bird watching. Look offshore and you may see dolphins and whales.

If your time is short in Kona, you may want to skip the park, but if you\u2019ve got the time to explore you may find this place worthwhile. Visitor center is open 8:30 AM to 4 PM daily.

Entry is $5 at the official park or 5$ to park at the beach so it's the same. Beach is a little to the north of the historical park. The historical part is well documented and interesting, but we were there primarily for the snorkeling.

The visitor's center sells knee pads ($13) so if you plan on crawling I would bring your own or buy some before heading out. You can also purchase hard-hat type helmets there for around $7. We brought bike helmets which were more sturdy and stayed put. The best cave for the beginner is Sentinel cave because you can walk all the way through it, the path is really developed and they even have stairs in places. Skull Cave and Merrell Cave require a lot of stair climbing to get to the bottom so be prepared for the long climb up those same steps when you are coming back up. ",

There isn't that much to see in the Visitors Center and some may balk at the entrance fee, but I found the 14 minute movie quite interesting and worth it. I was not aware of how much time Lincoln spent in Indiana and that it was during a crucial part of his growing up helping define who he was as a man. If you have young kids, since this is a National Park (this goes for all National Parks) have them participate in the Junior Ranger program. It helps make the visit a fun learning experience and when they complete the book, they get a badge. My daughter has gotten quite a few of these over the years and displays them on a vest. A nice keepsake as she gets older to remember our trips. We spent about 3 hours total there.",

This National Park is very inexpensive as it was $5.00 for a family and that was good for 7 days if we wanted to go back. The main building was nicely done and had a good movie. We then toured the grounds which were well kept. It might be a tough walk in the heat and humidity of summer, but it wasn't too bad the morning we were there. The grounds contain a working farm with animals and actors who are dressed for the time period. One thing that was a little disappointing was the cabin that Lincoln built with his father is not there (anymore). However, there is an outline on the ground of where it stood. I know it has been a long time since Lincoln lived there, but it would have been neat to see the cabin. This, like many other attractions in the area, is isolated and is a little bit of a drive off the Interstate, but it is a good look at the early life of our 16th President.",

It was very good. Wished we were able to spend more time. It was peaceful to walk the streets of the \"neighborhood\" as the weather was pleasant. Several of the homes are open for self-guided tours. Others are used as office space for federal agencies. Lincoln's home requires a guided tour. Free tickets are obtained in the visitor center. Tours were going off about every 20 to 30 minutes. Tour size appeared to be small (less than 20 people per tour). We didn't take the house tour so can't provide any information about the inside. The only negative is the paid parking. $2 per hour but there is a discount if you have a federal pass. This is the first place we've seen that actually accepts the federal pass for parking.

He taught himself to be a lawyer. Lincoln\u2019s house is 177 years old and he paid $1500 for it. He added on to the house 5 times. Three of his boys were born in the back parlor that was a bedroom at that time. The wall paper is an exact replica of what was there when the Lincolns were in residence and a lot of the furniture pieces were original to them. Lincoln had a perchance for stray cats and adopted any that came to the house. He also did not believe in discipline and his boys were terrors! The Lincolns went through sixteen hired girls (nanny and housemaid) while they lived in Springfield. Mary did all the cooking and the stove in the home is original and her second one. Our group looked around the renovated 4 block area with histories on placards outside the gates. ",

You can't touch doors or walls, but none of the kids on our tour were fussed at once - just given a little reminder. The rangers were great and very knowledgeable. There were period actors there. Mary Todd was in the visitor's center. Some younger girls (12 and 14) were dressed in period clothing and reading period stories to children. They all were willing to answer questions - my daughter asked how many clothes they had on (answer - 7 layers total). We both had a great few hours learning a little more about Lincoln.

You can walk in about half of them and there is some great reading and interesting original items for you to see inside. All the homes have been redone and preserved to the original look and size. Some you can walk around the back and see the barns and the gardens.

The place gives you the unmistakable feeling of being in the presence of greatness (despite the constant noise and bustle from the hordes of daily visitors). It truly is a befitting monument to a giant among men. Driving down from Chicago to Springfield to visit the Lincoln Home, we were hoping to experience something similar, if not greater. And I have to say it was a tad underwhelming. The house and neighborhood have been beautifully preserved/restored. For a while, the surroundings transport you back to the mid-1800s when the Lincolns called this place home. But we found the constant chatter of the tour guide very irritating. I realize they're supposed to stick to the script on these tours, but we found it an unnecessary distraction. Every section of the house has a board in the middle explaining the contents of the room and how it was used. There really is no need for the tour guide to say anything (or even do anything except stand around and make sure people don't touch stuff). It would have been a better idea for them to just be quiet and let people soak in the moment. There is so much history here, so much detail in the house, the furniture and surroundings that all you want to do is walk around taking it all in, trying to imagine what the Lincolns' life must have been like back then. There was no opportunity to do that, which was a bit disappointing. They keep hustling you from one room to another because the next group is about to catch up. Still glad to have visited though, despite all these issues. On a side note - if you visit on a not-so-busy-day, it actually makes sense to park out on the street. Parking on site is limited and it's also $2/hour. If you really want to look around you'll surely be in there at least a couple of hours.",

Our kids enjoyed playing some 19th century games in the lawn adjacent to Lincoln's home. Since they were so busy, they had tours running every 5 minutes and they had different park rangers stationed in different rooms of Lincoln's home.

Near the hangar is a building where you can buy tickets ($3.00 a person for adults, kids 17 and under free) for an inside tour of the Texas White House.

The property is huge and you need a car to get through the entire thing. The site has a ton of different things to see. We got there on a weekend and it wasn't crazy busy which was great. You drive to the visitor center to obtain a parking permit so you can stop along the various sites. You are given a map, and there is a small gift shop inside with a great selection of both LBJ and NPS merchandise. You then begin your trip to the several sights along the way, including the LBJ childhood home, family cemetery, school house, and finally the Texas White House. There is a second visitor center there where you can obtain tickets for the guided tour of the home, which runs $3 per person. The house itself is quaint and lovely, while the airplane outside is a very cool addition to the tour. There is a scenic view outside the home as well as a swing in the front yard. While we didn't have time to do the tour unfortunately, we did really enjoy ourselves. Word of advice, the short road to get to the house was closed so we drove the length of the park which happens to be an operating ranch. Cattle everywhere so stay in the vehicle if you're in the same situation. Worth the drive to see the home and very close to San Antonio if you want a quiet getaway from the busy atmosphere of the River Walk. ",

I'm old enough to remember LBJ's presidency and the visit was relevant to my life. The ranch is really beautiful country. When you stop at the state park visitor center to get a permit to be on the ranch, pick up the $7.00 CD that narrates your drive on the paved road around the ranch. See a reconstruction of the LBJ's birthplace and hear about his childhood. See his grandparents home and listen to the stories of their influence on him. The elementary school LBJ attended is on the property. Hear about the ranch operations from the CD and the ranch hand at the show barn. Look inside the US airplane in the hangar on his property. It shuttled the president and his cabinet to Austin where he could take a larger plane to WA D.C. Yes, he had a runway right there on the ranch. See some of the vehicles he used. The highlight for me was visiting the first floor of LBJ's home \"The Texas Whitehouse\". Filled with actual furnishings and personal items like LBJ and Lady Bird's clothing, you get a real sense of the man and his life. Be careful not to hit the cattle grazing freely on the ranch as you ride along and soak in the scenery and history. An absolute must see for any history buff.",

From seeing what the US was like just a little over 100 years ago when LBJ was born (and you can visit a working farm that was down the road from his birthplace), to the \"Texas White House\" it's a lovely way to spend a day. On top of that, if you DON'T go inside the Johnsons' home, it's FREE (and even to go into the home is a nominal $3/person fee). They give you a CD to pop into your car that is a guided tour as you drive around the ranch. The cars/airplane (Airforce one) were a big hit with our son - as was the working farm. All in all, a great way to spend a lovely day in the Hill Country. While you're there, take the drive on in to Fredericksburg - a jewel of a town with wonderful shops and places to eat. And there are all of these wineries on the road into Fredericksburg - so plenty to do.",

It was definitely worth the money, providing excellent directions and historical background, even some songs as we drove along. The ranch is very large, with beautiful flowers blooming in the fields.

When you check in with the Ranger there they give you a day pass and a CD to take an auto tour that leads to the ranch. No charge. You can stop and go as you please.......LBJ's grandparen'ts home, his childhood home, the family cemetary where he and Lady Bird are buried, plus the livestock barn and then the airplane hangar which is right by the Summer Whitehouse of LBJ. The hangar now houses a visitor center and gift shop area. There you can purchase your tour tickets for the retirement home (formerly the Summer Whitehouse) of Lyndon B. Johnson for $2. A Park Ranger gives a guided tour. It was wonderful. The furnishings are like you stepped back into the 1960's. We were there the later part of January and the weather was wonderful. The Ranch was beautiful. We loved our time there. After we left we traveled on to Johnson City. That is were the Lyndon Johnson Visitor Center is. There was lots of exhibits showing the timeline of his life. Very interesting. I recommend it to anyone that travels into that area.",

It was and still is a working Texas ranch and it provides an insight into LBJ and the life he enjoyed. The first floor of the ranch house has been carefully restored to the way it was while LBJ was president. The media-conscious nature of LBJ is evident by the triple-screen TV arrays in several rooms, including his bedroom.

        "text": "If you like presidential history or anything related to LBJ, you'll enjoy this Historical Park. It's divided into two areas(so you'll need a car) with one part in Johnson City and the other 14 miles away in Stonewall. The visitor center is located in Johnson City. It features some nice displays on LBJ and the timeline of what was happening at the same time. It features two films, one on LBJ and the other on his wife Lady Bird. I thougth the one on Lady Bird was nice. LBJ's boyhood home is across the street. You can only view it during a tour which is free. I think it's worth a visit. The Johnson City area also features the Johnson Settlement. I frankly think you can skip this part especially if it's a hot day or it's hard for you to walk. It was a long walk for something that's not really that exciting to see. As for the Park in Stonewall, you stop at the state park and pick up a CD for your visit. The CD includes some information on what you'll see and stories from LBJ. It was very helpful and free. I liked hearing LBJ on part of the CD describe some of his events. You are also able to stop at the Texas White House and take a tour. It costs one dollar and at the moment only features 3 rooms. As the National Park refurbishes more rooms they will become open to the public. I thought it was very neat to see inside the house and on the front lawn. One note about this national park. You now drive through this area in your OWN car. You no longer take a tour bus. It took me about 4 hours to visit both parks, but I also watched both films at the visitor center. I think you could easily do the whole thing in 2 hours if you wanted without feeling cheated.",

Living in Austin you are surrounding by LBJ and Lady Bird History and influence. This was a delight. First, I had no idea they were both buried on this property. No fan fare. In a family graveyard with nice grave stones but nothing over the top. The main house is $3 per person to enter but worth the effort and price. They have kept it as it was when they lived there. There are many of their personal items still in the home. Extremely interesting to look in their closets. Lady Bird sure did love color. The landing strip, the cars, etc are all interesting to see. I can only imagine what the world thought of Johnson City. Extremely glad we made the stop. Hope to return in the near future and spend more time on some of the other buildings on the property. We did the loop drive and spent our time at the main house. We also stopped at the graveyard. Nice that they let you do the loop in your own vehicle vs the bus I remember as a child.",

        "text": "The tour of the LBJ Ranch and the Texas White House was particularly interesting because of its unspectacular look. It was refreshing to see LBJ and Lady Bird generally furnished their house just like normal Americans would have during that period, except for maybe the wall phone right next to LBJ's toilet. Although Lady Bird and LBJ have both passed on (both are buried onsite in the family cemetary), the ranch is still a working ranch and the drive through it is well worthwhile. A stop at the showbarn is a must especially if you have kids in tow. The baby goats at the showbarn were star attractions. We were permitted to pet them although there are signs around which say to not touch the animals. It was hilarious petting the baby goats because as soon as we got close enough they went right to our shoelaces and tried eating them. It was all in fun and we left the barn with our shoelaces intact. The baby goats didn't starve, the ranch hands fed them while we were leaving. The Texas White House is the main draw on the ranch tour and costs only a few dollars per person to tour. Make sure you stop at the nearby state park to pick up your free tickets to tour the ranch, however. Air Force 1/2 is parked near the Texas White House. LBJ used the jet to fly between Austin and the ranch on his visits. The taxi-way for the jet leads from the parking apron near the house to the nearby runway. There is a small museum near the jet which has some information about LBJ's life and times. The museum does contain some of the vehicles LBJ used while at the ranch. One vehicle which stood out was the amphibious car which LBJ drove and unnerved his guests by declaring his brakes were out before jokingly driving right into the river which borders the ranch. Pictures may be taken of the grounds of the White House, but no pictures are allowed once inside the house itself. As for the house, the tour is a guided tour, so ask all the questions you may have. We toured LBJ's office, the living room, the dining room, the kitchen, LBJ bedroom, and Lady Bird's bedroom. Yes, they did have separate bedrooms. And as I said, phones were everywhere, even in LBJ's bathroom. Who knows what important business he conducted while in there. All the rooms are decorated with original furnishings, except for some pieces the daughters took for themselves. Nearly everything is unpretentious. The tour ends with a view of the pool and a car LBJ gave to Linda Bird on her 18th birthday. Also don't forget to visit the one room school house and a replica of LBJ's birthplace, both are along the ranch road. The LBJ cemetary and the replica birth house use the same parking lot. Enjoyed all aspects of the tour immensely!",

No stalactites of stalagmites to be seen. We saw two huge rooms with no formations. When we got to some formations at the very end of the tour he would not let us stop or photograph them.

First thing - If you want to do any of the Cave Tours get your tickets on-line in advance. Most of them sold out while we were there. Cave temperature is in the mid 50s all the time. It was 85 when we were there so a lot on people went on the tours in shorts and short sleeves. They regretted it! It was very cool in the cave. Pay close attention to the tour descriptions. They do a good job of describing how physically challenging they are. The ones with 700 steps are an effort. I am 66 years old and in good shape but the tours wore me out. The tours are interesting and well led by the rangers. The rest of the park is basically wooded with some nice hiking trails. Shop around for lodging outside the park and you can get some good rates. Park rates were to high. A lot of things in the area for families to do after seeing the cave. The trip to Bowling Green for the Corvette Museum is well worth the effort.

        "text": "I visited this site two times this past weekend. I had been to a Highland Games in Glasgow KY and needed to see some sites in the area other than men running around in kilts. My first visit to the cave included the \"historic\" tour, one of several offered visitors. The tour was quite good and the guide (a 5th generation guide of the cave) was entertaining and although we had a large group was easily heard as we made stops along the passage. The focus of the history apparently was more related to slavery and the contribution of African Americans to the cave than anything else, so I was a bit disappointed from a historian's standpoint, but the tour is definitely worth the price of admission. The second tour I took was the \"Domes and Dripstones' tour. This tour was along some winding and narrow passages of the cave and entry was via an almost vertical shaft of a sinkhole and is the park's newest entry into the cave system. It should be noted that if you have problems with your legs, are afraid of heights and slick footing you will probably NOT want to take this tour. As you enter the cave you take a series of flights of stairs to the lower portion of the passage some 200 feet down. For me this stair system was nothing short of an engineering and construction marvel given it snakes down through the natural structure of the cave. The guides were good and friendly, but were a bit shaky on their knowledge of cave structure. Training was needed here and that will come as the season progresses. Ate lunch at the hotel restaurant and service was okay and food was okay as well. The buildings (visitor center and hotel) are very nice and well maintained. The clerks at the tour purchase counter were helpful and friendly in spite of a rather large crowd the days I was there. Food in the campground store was so high it was a joke. A loaf of bread, a small package of sandwich meat and American cheese slices was a little over $13.00. Typical tourist trap and a surprise since this is one of America's prime parks.",

The rangers were helpful on tour information at the VC and the guide on the Dome and Dripstones tour was funny. The tour itself was pretty cool. Don't expect to take many photos, it's too dark. There are a lot of stairs over 2 hours, often passing through small spaces. The big downside was the size of the tour group - about 80 people. The tour moves single file through the cave to a few different stopping points where the group gathers. If you're not in the front half, the ranger starts talking to the group due to timing and you will miss some information or stories. Please do not take babies on the tour. It was very hard to hear the guide sometimes with a crying baby at one point. The self-guided discovery in the large room is not informative - there are maybe 2 info plaques. The space is quite astounding and might be worth the $5 admission.",

The Tour gives insight on how caves are formed, a history of early cave dwellers and explorers as well as some of the commercial uses of the caves. There are Rangers on hand to offer information on various points of the Tour. This tour drops 160 feet in elevation, includes a total of 160 stairs and includes all of the Mammoth Passage Tour and part of the Historic Tour and takes about a 1/2 hour to complete.

Yet, it is a easy walk inside. I personally though they needed a little more walking path light for people. Still, there wasn't really anything to see:( It's just a cave, charging people $5.00 for this is really sad:( There are park guides in the cave to answer questions:) Yet, with the many people in the cave due to coming and NOT being able to do any other tours made it somewhat crowded:( No information explaining anything about the cave:( And WHO could find a guide within the darkness and crowd? Howabout give them glow lights or something to stick out amongst the crowd.You will notice signage boards outside the cave before entering explaining many things:) Still, some of the signs are worn out and make them hard to read:( Detail is everything:) when it seems your getting charged for everything:( Liked the gift shop, could not buy a shirt due to no medium sizes:( I have visited 63 national parks for far:) This one was probably the most disappointing:(",

I'm somewhat not cool with tight areas, but I was fine. It's not like that the whole way though and opens up to pretty big spaces. All the super cool stuff is at the end, where of course everyone wants pictures. Our ranger got noticeably cranky at the end (I guess because they want more tours to come in), but really they must know people want to enjoy it a little. They could make the tour 15 minutes longer or cut out some of the talking in the middle or just be patient with the people on the tour. They definitely try to rush you through.

The non school adults were driven in a separate bus and placed in front of the kids during are tour. Thank you, Rangers. With that said,, the kids were well behaved and asked really good questions. And our ranger was very good with this group of youngsters. Now there are a number of steps on the Dome and Dripstone Tour plus a number of tight spaces. Fear not. If you are in average condition it shouldn't be a problem. Do bring a jacket as the temperature is a constant 54 degrees year round. Wear sensible shoes- no flip flops or sandals. Also remember that tours can sell out quickly during the summer and spring break. You can always go online to secure a tour but not the day of. If you try the day of you will have to call them instead of going online. Don't be like a number of folks who drive to Mammoth Cave to find it sold out for the day.

It is so large, that it has numerous tours covering various sections and varying in length from a short introductory tour to a four hour wild cave tour. Of special interest is the Trog Tour, which is a wild cave tour for younger children, no adults (except for the guide) allowed. Four of my grandchildren (3 boys and 1 girl) did the tour and loved crawling through dark reaches of the cavern with only a headlamp. All of the tours are great. I have done all but the adult wild cave tour. If you are a first time visitor, the shorter tours are a good start, though I would not recommend the very short intro tour unless that is all you can do, only because you only get a brief history lesson and get to see one large room. There is so much of this cave to see. There are very dry parts to very wet parts. You can book in advance online and should since most of the tours are small and sell out quickly. All tours involve negotiating step and inclines, though all have nice paths except for the wild cave tours. Some tours involve a lot of stairs so check closely the tour you are booking. If you wait to book when you get there, you will be very limited. The Grand Avenue tour is long, but by far my favorite. Tickets are half price for annual pass and senior citizens with a pass. The grounds in the park have lots of trails, a nice river and a campground with no hookups. There is a general store, a nice hotel and two eating options.

After descending, you walk through white limestone tunnels and past some nice rock formations, stopping at points along the way for talks and demonstrations from our tour guides. The cave is somewhat \"primitive\" with minimal lighting and natural walkways, so, it does help to wear shoes with good tread on them.

It was a great tour, we had a very personable and knowledgeable tour guide (I believe his name was Bob) but I was disappointed that we did not enter in through the \"Historic Entrance\" as I am a huge fan of caverns and entering the cavern is part of the cave experience. I do believe they have a tour that enters through the historic entrance but at the time it was under construction. We instead entered through a single door entrance with tight twisty stairs descending immediately. Be aware that the stairs are wet, narrow in a lot of spots and the rocks jut out in various spots so watch your head, wear comfortable shoes suitable for the activity. A majority of the cave is unadorned limestone with only the very end of the tour featuring stalagmites and stalactites, but our tour guide was informative and entertaining and the tour was great from start to finish. You can take pictures but WITH OUT flash so prep your camera ahead of time as it is difficult to do so in the dark and walking down steep steps fussing with a camera is not a great idea and you will miss out on the cave experience. We did not explore the park any further as we were on our way to Louisville, KY but what we did see was very beautiful, would love to return and hike some of the available trails.

If you are in poor health, have difficulty walking 3 to 4 miles or are afraid of dark confined spaces - limit your visit to the above ground Park. The tour we took was 2 miles, 500 plus stair steps and some tight squeeze through spots. I would go again if we didn't live a 1000 miles away.",

They have a wonderful visitor's center with a nice gift shop that offers a Veteran's Discount. Here you can purchase tickets to all the various cave tours that MCNP has to offer. For our first adventure, we all decided to do the walking tour on the hiking path, which was free. The scenery is gorgeous! A very nice hike through the forestry with a great stop at an open cave. This was great because it was very hot outside and the cave provided a natural air-conditioning for us to cool off in. There is a lot of walking downhill & uphill - so be prepared for that. We went a bit off-trail on our tour. We came to the end of the first trail which was a wooden bridge. We hopped over the wooden bridge & went down to the cave. This was super cool because there was natural spring in the cave. This hiking tour requires moderate physical exertion. Nothing extreme, but one needs to be in good health to do it. All in all, this was a top-notch experience & we highly recommend going here. You don't want to miss MCNP!!!",

I would rate the park staff a 1, and thus my overall rating is a 3. The park staff we encountered (ticket desk, bus drivers, and Ranger J) were not friendly at all. We also were shocked at how rude the ranger was to several of the visitors on the tour. I highly recommend a cave tour anyway.

        "text": "You might visit Mammoth Cave National Park just to take a cave tour but there is as much to see above ground as there is below ground. The park is located in western Kentucky, just off I-65. There is no charge to enter the park but there are charges for the various tours of the cave system. If you are not familiar with Mammoth Cave, it is the longest known cave system in the world. The tours that are offered by the park service are of varying length in distance, depth, and time. The number and type of tours change depending on the time of year and, in our case, construction and repairs. You should visit the Mammoth Cave web site and search for tours and schedules and to make reservations. My wife and I opted for the 2 hour Domes & Dripstones Tour for a cost of 15 dollars each. Tickets may be purchased online and picked up at the Visitors Center or you can purchase your ticket there - if there is still space available. I highly recommend that you go to the Visitors Center well before your tour and spend some time there. The museum/education center is outstanding! While the gift shop is small and offers the usual, generic National Park items it also offers items unique to Mammoth Cave. Before the tour, you are warned that you should be in good health as you will make use of about 500 stairs. It's also a bit of a tight fit in several places, especially if you are on the tall side. For this reason (and others) I do not recommend taking children less than 3 years old - 'nuff said. Our tour loaded onto busses near the Visitors Center, and took us to the \"New Entrance\". Our guide, a Park Service Ranger named Rick (no kidding, Ranger Rick), set a brisk pace, which left little time for pictures. BTW - do not try to take pictures while walking: it's too dark and the cave itself doesn't like it and might reach out and smack you on the head. However, when entering into the various chambers and rooms we usually took a break, and we were able to get some good pictures. I also do not recommend taking less than 3 years - 'nuff said. The highlight had to be \"Frozen Niagara\", a massive flowstone 130 feet below the ground surface. All and all, a most enjoyable tour but far too short. ",

There is no entrance fee like other National parks, but this is probably because you pay for the cave tours. There are several cave tours, the most popular seemed to be the Domes and Dripstones tour as it had the most available times. Cost is $15pp. You can book a tour on line, we were able to walk in and sign up for the 11am one. There is a museum in the visitor center as well as a gift store, information booth. The Domes and Dripstones cave tour lasted about 2 hrs. Though rated as moderate, it may be strenuous for those not used to lots of stairs up and down. There were several stops on the tour where you can sit on benches while the ranger talked about the cave. There are no restrooms. The tour was crowded with 120 people and two Rangers, one leading, one in the back. Those in the back missed some information but overall the Rangers did a great job and the cave is spectacular. Bring a light jacket if you get cold, though the stairs definitely get you sweating! We brought small flashlights which were helpful. After the tour you can walk down a hill to the historic cave entrance. There is also a historic tour which takes you there, but it was full. A lodge and restaurant are nearby if you need food. It is so amazing that hundreds of miles of caves exist under this park and that Mammoth Cave is only a small part! If you are just passing through, it is still possible to stop and take a tour if you plan it right as the park is only about 7-10miles from I65.",

However, these tours are very large (over 100 people) if you are not near the front you miss out on the majority of the tour (Jerry talking about things and pointing things out).

One we had already taken on a previous visit, so that left the Frozen Niagara Tour and the Dripstones and Domes Tour. Since the Dripstones tour is considerably longer, includes the entire Frozen Niagara Tour, and only costs $2 more, it seemed the better choice. As we gathered for the tour and our ranger, Jacob explained how strenuous it was going to be, encouraging anyone with medical issues to strongly consider this choice, I realized that this was not a good choice for me. I told my boy friend I thought I should stay behind. He insisted I'd be fine, and he would \"help\" me get through it. I tried to tell him that didn't make sense, but he pointed out that I'd managed similar tours in the past. I let him cajole me into it, even though I was sure it was a bad idea. By the time we got to the bottom of the 280 steep steps that get you down into this cave I knew I was in a world of trouble. My legs were so weak they wouldn't even hold me up. They never did get better, and it was only the patience and calm assistance of the assistant guide, Bobby, and an EMT whose name I did not catch, that eventually got me out of that cave. These folks were very professional and were very kind, but they did ask the obvious question: What could we have said to keep you from going in there? I told them that some of us have difficulty saying \"NO\" to the people we love - so all I can pass on to others in the future is don't let yourself be talked into trying this if your instincts are telling you no. It is a beautiful tour, and if you are in good shape by all means go and enjoy. If you have any issues with heart, lungs, back, or knees, go on the Frozen Niagara Tour instead.

Please be advised that most of the various Cave Tours fill up in advance and it is HIGHLY Advised to buy your tickets on line well in advance. The web site is very accurate in their tour descriptions. There are many levels and types of tours at several entrances to this 400 mile system of tunnels and caves. There are also several enjoyable hiking paths of several lengths above ground. This is a full service National Park with camping and rental options, with camp stores and all facilities. There is also a very nice Visitors Center with an interesting museum and frequent hands on activities.",

You get to see 3 different types of caves all in one visit, which was very interesting. Our guide was extremely knowledgeable and took time to answer all of our questions.

Be advise it is 54 degrees in the cave year 'round. We stayed in the campground which was very nice. The only complaint I have about it is there are no showers so you have to go to the camp store and pay $3.00 for a 10 minute shower in a rather crummy shower stall. I thought that was a bit much.

The cave was gorgeous and interesting... a very unique divergence from the hilly and equally beautiful landscape above in the park. My kids thought they were in The Goonies! Word of caution, some of the passages are very narrow and low - so if you're extremely claustrophobic you're probably not reading this review, and you really wouldn't like that part of it. There are also \"cave crickets\" that cling upside down to the ceiling of the cave (do all cave creatures hang upside down? I should've asked the ranger). They look quite a bit like spiders and if they catch you off guard can be quite off-putting! Additionally, the temperature was significantly lower in the subterrain than above ground (the heat index was 119, it was about 60 degrees in the cave... any longer than 45 minutes and we would've been cold) so maybe pack a sweatshirt or light long-sleeved shirt.",

We did last minute online reservations the night before for the 11:15AM Domes & Dripstones and 2:45PM Historic for Friday. This gave us plenty of time to have lunch and look around in between tours. For the D&D tour we hopped on a bus that took us to the cave entrance. The cave, while much cooler than the 95 deg outside, was not as cool as we expected (60's?) and we didn't wear jackets that we brought (this was not the case with the 2nd tour). The tour guide was funny. We saw cool formations and the hike and stairs were manageable for those of us who are not normally active. We were on the bus and back at the visitors center exactly 2hrs after leaving. We didn't pack a lunch so we decided to eat at the Park's hotel dining room. The three of us had burgers/fries/drink and the bill came out to $35.56. Waitress was nice enough to give us our refills in \"to-go\" cups without being asked. The Historic tour started with a short walk from the visitors center to the cave entrance. Since the first cave had some tight spaces, we decided to leave our backpacks. Daughter left her jacket and regretted it as soon as we were at the cave entrance which was very cool (50's?). Historic tour had beautiful rooms and passages despite not having many formations. It was our favorite of the two. As we aren't as petite as our daughter (I'm 5'9 and DH is 6'5\") we were nervous about Fat and Tall man's misery. DH was hunched over for a good portion of the low cave areas, pretty much after the large entrance passage 30 mins into the tour and for Tall Man, he was on his hands and crawled on the tips of his toes. He was not comfortable but got through it. There were some breaks and waiting until the bottleneck cleared in front of you helped so that he was not stuck in the bent position for extended periods of time but I'm sure he will be feeling it tomorrow. Despite the tight spots, he had a good time exploring and admitted to being \"bit by the cave bug\" and asked when we could come back to check out some of the other tours :)",

This visit was impromptu, a stop on my way back to Louisville from Franklin, and I was not dressed appropriately nor did I have the appropriate shoes. I was able to join the 1:30 p.m. \u201cDomes and Dripstones\u201d tour for $14.00. From the Visitor Center back parking lot, we boarded a reconditioned school bus for a short ride to the cave entrance. The bus dropped us off at the top of a large sinkhole and the rangers gave us a brief orientation of the tour. There are stairs leading to the door of the cave entrance, the first of many, many stairs throughout the tour. It was dark and dank, and sometimes wet, inside the cave. The steel stair steps were covered so they were not as slippery as they could have been. The cave\u2019s floor is uneven and it was a challenge if you were not wearing shoes with good tractions (like I was). A handheld flashlight would have helped as I navigated through dimly-lit passages. The tour lasted two hours and the park rangers were informative and managed the group well. I was disappointed to learn they no longer do boat tours inside the cave (those are outdated photos on the World Heritage Site listing), because the wood in the boats were harmful to an endangered species of shrimp. Needless to say, it was a fun tour and I enjoyed the visit. At the end of the tour, when we were offloaded from the bus back at the Visitor Center, we were required to wipe our shoes on bio-security maps to avoid spreading the White Nose Syndrome affecting bats to other areas. One can easily spend many hours at Mammoth Caves National Park, but I had to return to Louisville so I left right after the tour. Mammoth Caves National Park is on Central Time, so I was an hour behind Eastern Time already. Enjoy your visit!",

Hotel not a grand one...orig. burned down early 1900's. we arrived early for our reservation..checked to see if we could switch out our tour ticket times to earlier time...$3 charge per ticket to cancel. not worth it. so spent alot of time checking out their history rooms (nice hands on but phones to hear the info out of date), gift shops, nice bathrooms, checked out hotel, got some coffee and snacks. main restaurant not inviting enough to stay for a meal.",

Our first time thru we went on the Mammoth Passage Tour, and I remember very little about that tour. This time we went on the Domes and Dripstones Tour and saw the Frozen Niagara and the beautiful dripstones area. I would suggest that you read about every tour to decide which one you will feel most comfortable participating in. Many of them have lots of stairs to navigate, tight spots, wet areas, and big drops. So if you are claustrophobic or have a fear of heights, you might want to choose one of the easier tours. Mammoth Cave was impressive, but I think I prefer some of the smaller caves like Ruby Falls.",

Still, it is a cave network and it is dark inside, so folks who do have claustrophobia probably don't want to visit this park. We had an excellent guide, which was a real plus.

Fairly large cave rooms with one end featuring heavy formations that are well let and you get very up close and personal with them. If your wanting only formations though, Marengo Cave has more formations than anything I've ever seen.

I remember seeing pictures in National Geographic in the '50s and never dreamed I would get to actually visit. We did the Historic Tour which is one of many that are offered. Some are just not for old folks like me. The Historic Tour is about a 2 mile trek with some interesting but doable challenges. There is a narrow section that meant turning sideways to navigate followed by a low passage that meant stooping along for a bit. But, those only added to the fun. Since the tour goes down 360 feet it must also return 360 feet. That meant a 155 step spiraling staircase, with frequent landings, to reach the exit level. The rangers were very friendly, informative and enthusiastic. Well worth the $6 per person (if you have the Sr. pass) or even the full $12. Be sure to wear good shoes, a light coat and comfortable clothes. I actually was in shorts with a light coat that I really did not need. The walking and effort kept the blood circulating good. However, some do need the coat. The temperature is a constant 54 degrees. Be sure to check out the constraints of other tours. Some of them are not possible for some folks. By the way...since we drive a Hybrid Camry we had priority parking. How nice is that?",

There were some artifacts left in the cave since operation. Really the only thing brought out on the tour is a stop where some guy signed his name on a wall, with a story. You won't see stalactites/stalagmites, or any thing of color, basically rock. Tour guide made the tour because of her humor. If you have health issues, don't go. We had an older couple on the tour, one carrying a cane. Right away, the guides warned people if there were doubts, to reconsider. The older couple had me scratching my head when they took the lead with the tour guide. I wondered how they were doing, I found out, on the ascent. We passed them on the plat formed exit, and they were taking a serious break. Not even out of the cave yet, they still had a steep inclined walk back to visitors center. If you are out of shape and the temperature is hot, you will sweat, walking back to your car. There are many tours, but this one was about as strenuous as we were going to take. I asked about a veteran discount, and thanks to the inquiring of the tour receptionist on my service related disability, she set me up with a lifetime National Parks Access Pass.

We did the 'historic cave\" tour and \"Domes and Drip Stones\". These are two entirely different experiences and both are highly rewarding. Some of the other tours overlap material included in these tours so read the descriptions carefully to avoid duplication. Pay attention to the tour descriptions. Some of the tours are strenuous and once you've started you are committed for the duration. Ask yourself if closed spaces are a problem because some of the passageways are TIGHT. Allow some time to read the background material in the modern visitor center exhibits. You'll learn a lot. Allocate at least a day here... anything less and you are cheating yourself. You could easily spend more time and never be bored... especially if you put in any time on the surface park.

There were 26 in our tour and Jerry our guide said he had as many as 125. After meeting at Shelter B, a bus took us to the entrance and we started our descent. There are lockers at the shelter where you can leave a backpack or purse but it is just as easy to leave it in your trunk. Our guide was from that area and had a rich family history which made the tour even more special. My boys 10 and 14 loved this tour. They enjoyed squeezing and ducking through the cave walls as we made our way down the stairs. After the bus brought us back to the Visitor Center, we had lunch in the restaurant. The choices were limited but it was reasonability priced and quickly prepared. We hiked around the Visitor Center when we were done before leaving for our next stop. There are tons of hiking and biking trails in the area so you definitely could spend an entire day or two taking in the area.

I read several other reviews of cave attractions in the area (the zip line one), but thought it would be better to give my dollars to the National Parks. I was glad I did. You don't have to pay an entry fee to get in the park which was a pleasant surprise. You also don't have to pay to park, so you can spend the day in the park for no money at all. The only thing that I saw you have to pay to enjoy are the cave tours, a back country permit or the on site hotel. The facility here is beautiful. I heard the ranger say it was three years old. There are indoor bathrooms, a very small gift shop and plenty of hiking trails and shelters to picnic. I made my reservation for the \"historic\" tour online a week ahead of time. When I arrived, the helpful ranger pulled up my reservation and I had my ticket with no problems at all. In the two hours before my tour started, I was able to hike a few of the trails. It was a beautiful, unusually mild February day. I'm not an avid hiker and didn't come prepared to hike. I just had water, a jacket and tennis shoes. I did fine on the main trails around the visitor center. The trail to the river was a challenge on the way up the hill for me, but a good workout. The historic cave tour itself started with warnings about health, claustrophobia and minding your children. All three warnings were for good reason. There were about 4-5 areas of the tour where at 5' 3\", I had to crouch. Tall people, be warned. There was also an area of the tour (\"Fat Man's Misery\") where you shimmy and squeeze between these natural rock formations about 4 feet tall. The guide said the gaps are 18\" wide. This was one of the highlights for me. I felt like a giant making my way through the grand canyon! Large people, claustrophobic people, special needs people, be warned. The final highlight of the tour for me was winding up several hundred stairs to get back to ground level and seeing the beautiful waterfall that had formed due to melting snow and ice. This was a challenging stairway hike, but doable for average people. I was in the front of the group just behind the guide- which I recommend for anyone not wanting to have the experience of running to catch up, listening to everyone's chatter or children and hearing the impromptu comments from the guide. The overall experience could have been better. The tour guide was a colorful Kentucky fellow really uptight about camera flashes (which I didn't mind). The tour experience depended on listening to his rendition of the cave's highlights. There were no signs anywhere in the cave- which could have provided more information. There were areas at the beginning of the cave that were poorly lit where people banged into each other. I felt this was a bigger safety hazard than a wayward camera flash. The tour was light on interesting history and facts, but still interesting. Improved lighting, some signage and more historical or geological facts would have made this a 4 or 5 star place, Definitely a worthwhile stop. A true bargain at $12 for a 2 hour experience.",

The \"Historical Tour\" is the traditional one that is nice to do if you went when you were a kid. It is relatively easy and has a variety of different views. Last week we took the \"New Entrance Tour\" and that was just amazing. This tour is not easy, though - lots of steps, ups and downs, etc. However, if you can hike 2.5 miles without much difficulty then you can handle this tour. The tour had 3 parts - A, B and C. A was the climb down. 280 steps straight down with twists and turns and small spaces. Wear tennis shoes and even calf-high socks if you have them, as the back of my calfs were scraped from the steps down. You open-up into a large room, which starts B. B is climbing up and down and around with some beautiful sights. C is the Frozen Niagara, which is a mineral deposit that looks like a waterfall. They give you the option to take an additional 48 steps to go under the falls - DO IT. It was my favorite part of the tour and even though I was pooped by then, it was well worth it and not a lot of extra effort. Looking up at the falls - wow. They let you rest in between each stage and you're in a cool cave, anyway, so it wasn't too strenuous. And the Niagara is near the exit, you did your climbing-up in stage B. Each tour was about $12, I believe, and takes roughly 1.5-2 hours. You have guides with you. If you're vacationing anywhere near western Kentucky then Mammoth Cave is a must-do!",

Glad I did - I got the last spot on the two hour guided tour of the New Entrance, and it was entertaining and educational. The National Park Service ranger was, as usual for this bunch, excellent, providing us with fun facts and figures throughout the tour. Hard to beat for $12. If you do go - make reservations!

My daughter's admission was free & I think I had to pay twelve dollars for mine, which is well worth it. Took a short bus ride to the cave, then headed underground. To start, you'll have to go down approximately 300 steps or so, and they're all different sizes, heights, and shapes, some where you need to weave around portions of rock. I'm not complaining I had fun, and surprisingly, so did my daughter. I just wanted to give out this information to help anyone considering this adventure-- definitely not handicap accessible, or for anyone with bad knees (or any other major health concern). My only real complaint, which I know is no one's fault & there can't be anything done about this, is that there were way too many giant legged cave crickets crawling inches away from my face, clothes, and hair, on the low ceilings and cramped walls. Those things terrify me, so I shrieked an awful lot more than I'd care to admit. Otherwise, a fun outing! Thank you, Mammoth Cave!",

I'll say that we made it though the 2 hour guided walking tour because we are all fairly active but if you aren't I wouldn't recommend this tour as there are over 400 steps to retreat the cave. Now on to the fun stuff, we saw a couple of bats on the ceiling, there were \"fat man squeezes\" (our biggest guy is 260 so...), lots of history, opportunities to ask questions, plenty of photo opportunities, they even turn the lights out so you can see just how dark it is inside. Children must be well behaved and accompany an adult the entire tour or they will be escorted out we were told, we didn't have that problem! :) Make sure you dress warm as it's in the 50's year around. Tickets were $12 for adults, $6-8 for kids and the tour guides made it worth it. Would love to go back and try another tour next time but this one was great!",

We boarded the bus with 59 others and drove about 4 miles to the cave entrance. The guide was very informative, but the fact is that Mammoth is just a hole in the ground. Slightly less boring than lava tubes, but if you're expecting giant rooms full of stalactites and stalagmites, you'll be disappointed. Keep in mind I have been in several dozen cave systems across the US and Europe, so first-timers might find this more interesting.",

Don't forget the new museum with interactive displays. The visitor center is new and beautiful. Tip: if you go during summer months or busy times go get your tickets early as the tours do sell out.

I think it is because we have been to other major cave systems and figured \"seen one, seen 'em all.\" Couldn't be more wrong on that - this place is freakin' amazing. The ranger who guided our tour (the \"Classic\" tour) was great at his job and added a lot to the experience. We will absolutely go back to see other sections of the cave system - the historical uses and details are fascinating. One surprise is that the Annual NP Pass which we have did NOT cover the cost of the tour. Finally, when the ranger goes over the physical demands of the tour - trust that there is no exaggeration and if you don't feel up to it, choose a different tour.

I have been going to this park from the time I was pre teen and that was in the 1950s. I have seen a lot change as time passed. But the main item, the cave still remains the best part. We took a light tour of four hours and viewed some of the History of the cave and heard stories and History from a very special guide. Our Guide was a direct decendent of the three original guides from over a hundred years ago. On our tour we viewed the large passages and areas where products used to make gun powder were mined. We also did some twisty cruves and climbing that was hard at times. But we survived and had a great time. Staying at the Park has many levels. In the past I have stayed in cabins that were very low end in price, and once in the big lodge that was high end on price. My favarite was the old Hotel now torn down. Food options are good with a reasonable priced full service resturant to a modern snak bar service. The full sevice resturant has a good but basic menu and is based on country family type foods. All very good and filling. Little stores abound to see any type of Tenn or cave rememberance there is. This is a more than one day and less than two day for a quick visit but my recomedation is to stay for three nights. That was one can enjoy a day under and a day over on a trail or river visit. They have a web site for information and it can be helpful but if you travel like me, it will serve only as a guide. If your going to stay in park you MUST secure the room, if not you will pay $$. The entire staff down to the kitchen staff have a very friendly attitude and seem to be sure to make the visit a good one. In my youth i used to do \"wild\" caving or spelunking as it is called. You can do some wilder caving here but need to be in much better shape than I am now. Go, enjoy, and experence wild America.",

It was kind of generic and certainly made us want to do other tours, but we had 10 hours of travel ahead of us that day. They say the average temp on all tours is 54 degrees so bring a sweatshirt for everyone.

At this time, our guide would tell us something about that section of the cave. Our guide, Kevin, was great. He has been there for many years and is very knowledgeable as well as funny! We enjoyed his humor and fun spirit. After about a 1.5 miles (all very flat), we stopped in the Snowball Room for lunch. They had lunch you could purchase, but we brought in sandwiches and snacks. The website states that you could only bring in food in a clear backpack or ziploc bags, but apparently they've recently changed this and you can now carry in bags or backpacks. They did ask us to bring in clear water bottles, though they never checked this. For $8.50 boxed lunches, I think you got a sandwich, soup and drink. They also had bathrooms and water fountains here.

We visited on the Tuesday right after Memorial Day and found no crowds at all. We took the New Entrance Tour, which has a ticket limit of 114 -- we had just 7 people in our group and it was fantastic! The ranger guiding the tour was able to get into a lot more explanation and interaction with such a small group. I strongly recommend you visit on an \"off day,\" because this must be hard with a large group -- you have to walk single file, and there are only a few places on this tour where you can gather a group for a talk about what you're seeing. New Entrance is a good tour if you are concerned about strenuousness. You walk down 280 steps, straight down a shaft, at the very start. But you only have to come up 220 (to a different exit), and these steps are spaced out along the route, not all at once. $12 per person and well worth it.",

The Grand Avenue Tour is a 4 1/2 hr tour that winds through a large section of the cave. It is rated as difficult, and if you have trouble walking up and down steep slopes, this may not be for you. The kids (8 and 13) had no trouble with the walking. There are frequent stops for narrative from the guide, so a reasonably fit person will have no trouble with the tour. The steps were easy compared to the occasionally steep and slippery slopes. 90% of the tour is through tubes formed by the river long ago. You will see large rooms, narrow canyons, wide tubes, and a few tight squeezes between rocks. It can get a bit monotonous since all the rocks look about the same. It is a dry cave, so other than the Frozen Niagra at the very end of the tour, you will not see the stalagtites and other formations that are plentiful in a wet cave (like Diamond Caverns). The guide was informative with a lot of talk about the geology and history of the cave. You eat lunch around 1 hour into the tour. The box lunch of a ham or turkey sandwhich, chips, apple, cup of vegetable soup, and drink is $7.50. They also have PB&J. The food was unremarkable, but hey, you're eating in a cave. Tour size was around 70 people, so don't expect any enroute commentary unless you are right behind the guide. This is a good tour for people who have an interest in cave geology and would like a nice walk, but you can see many of the more interesting features of the cave on shorter, less expensive tours.",

I sat at the Steinway in the foyer and listened to the beautiful sounds as I gently touched the keys. The next morning 7 servers made us a huge breakfast and we were given an extensive guided tour of the mansion and the grounds. It was an unforgettable experience.

They converted one of the buildings into the \"headquarters/shop.\" Our tour started at the front of the house with a history lesson as to why they houses were \"faux,\" how you would have been \"announced\" upon arrival and the importance of the bottom level being the floor that is lavishly decorated because that is where you IMPRESS your visitors. Though you cannot go all the way into the rooms, you can go about 8 feet which allows you to really look around. Ranger Schoby knew his stuff and was a fun, interactive tour guide (had some really boring ones). Upstairs is the living quarters which was not lavish due to the fact that only close family and friends came there and you do not need to impress them. This was one of the 1st houses that had a running water shower, using gravity. He pointed out the wires on the outside that use to hold bells that would summon the slaves.

Get there as early as you can to buy your tour tickets. You must have guide tours of Cliff House and Balcony House and the $5 is a very reasonable fee for these guide tours. Both of the visits are strenuous, especially the Balcony House where you have to crawl through an 18 inch wide passageway and climb up about 100 feet of ladders to get out. Nor for the faint of heart but a great visit. You can also stop to see Spruce House from across the small canyon - it is closed for visits due to rock slides.

While hiking is an essential component for many visitors, it is possible to see the Step House with <1 mile of walking (R/T), on smooth surface with only 100 ft change in altitude - nothing too steep or taxing, with places to rest along the way if needed. The Cliff Palace is visible, and easily appreciated, from a great vantage point at the at the visitor center.

        "text": "We only had one day to spend in Mesa Verde National Park on the day after Labor Day. I wanted to do all three of the guided tours-Long House, Balcony House, and Cliff Palace-in one day. I was told by the rangers that it would be difficult to do get tickets and to do all three tours. About 7 weeks in advance of our trip, I purchased the twilight tour of Cliff Palace for 6:45 PM at a cost of $20. The other two tours-Long House and Balcony House need to be purchased in person, either at the Colorado Welcome Center in Cortez or at the Mesa Verde Visitor and Research Center near the entrance of the park. These tickets can be purchased in person two days in advance for $5 each. I was concerned that the tickets may not be available when we arrived in Cortez around 5PM the day before we visited the park. I had called both places to ask about the possibility of getting two tickets for each tour (as the tours limit the number of people). I was told that there was a good possibility, but not a guarantee, as we were a smaller group. I was told that if there are larger groups, obtaining tickets would be more difficult. If you are staying at a B&B, it may be a possibility to ask your host to get tickets for you. I had also read on tripadvisor that on busier days, you may not be allowed to buy tickets to all three tours. Don't know if that happens or not. Anyway, we were able to get tickets at the Colorado Welcome Center for the tour times that I wanted. So, this is how our schedule went on the day that we visited. We entered the park at 7:20 AM. There was no one to take entrance fees at that time. We have a senior pass anyway. This happened had three other national parks that we visited this vacation which seems odd since the national parks need more revenue. We arrived at Wetherhill Mesa at 8:15 AM. So, it took us 55 minutes. The road is winding and we did not stop for viewpoints as it was hazy due to smoke from the Montana fires. We took the Long House guided tour at 9AM, returning to our starting point at 11:15 AM. We took a short rest break and did the self guided tour of Step House. Walking to and from the Step House and visiting it took only 35 minutes. We left Wetherhill Mesa and drove to Chapin Mesa which took 35 minutes. One ranger said that it could take 1.5 hours during a busy day to drive that same route. At Chapin Mesa, we ate lunch at the Spruce Tree House Restaurant, saw the 25 minute movie at the Archaeological Museum which runs on the half hour, and toured the rest of the museum. At the rear of the museum, you can view the Spruce Tree House dwelling but it is closed due to structural deficits. From 2:15-3:25 PM, we did the one-way Mesa Top Loop Road, stopping at nearly all of the dozen sites. Pick up a free brochure at the first stop, the Pithouse, which explains the Mesa Top Loop Drive sites. It provides information that will give the sites more meaning. It was the only place in the park that I saw that particular brochure. We had tickets for the Balcony House tour at 5PM which lasted until 6:10PM. Out of all the three tours, that was the tour that was most strenuous in terms of climbing 32 foot ladders to get into the house and then climbing four smaller ladders on the side of a cliff clutching onto metal rungs in the cliff between the ladders to get out of the house. Lastly, we did the 6:45 PM Twilight Cliff House Tour. That tour was suppose to last 1.5 hours but it lasted about half the time. It was disappointing as there was little information provided by our young ranger and we were free to leave after we had looked around. It was dark exciting the park so be careful as we saw wildlife on our way out.",

The park ranger at the visitor center laughed when I asked for a 2 hour highlight tour recommendation. It's in a remote area of Colorado so you need to spend an hour or two to get to the Park entrance. Then another 30+ minute drive to get to the top of the Mesa and more time to drive the loops. It's such as beautiful place you'll want to take your time. 2. If you want to take a tour, book in advance. There aren't many and they were sold out when we got there. The one that looks interesting is the 700 Years Tour but it's 4 hours and pricey ($47 plus park fee), requires climbing and you're on a bus with other people. 3. If you're doing your own thing and pressed for time, skip the visitor center, grab a map at the pay booth, drive by the many overlooks and head to Chapin Mesa and listen to the 30 minute video on the people who lived in the cliff dwellings. Fascinating! There's a snack bar Spruce Terrace with affordable food, outdoor seating and a BBQ going that day. Pass on the ribs but everything else was tasty. View the Spruce Tree House from afar - the trail was closed and tours were suspended. 4. If it's overcast that day, go anyway. Your dwelling pictures will be better when the sun is behind the clouds as long as there's good indirect light. 5. Skip the Mesa Loop unless you have time to kill - you'll see dwellings from afar, the Sun Temple and some holes in the ground. 6. Don't miss the Cliff Palace loop and overlook. A short walk down will allow you to get reasonably close to the dwellings without a tour ticket and take great photos - pray for clouds. The other overlooks were nice but skip the Balcony House overlook - you can't see much without a tour ticket. 7. A stop at the Far View Lodge and Terrace Restaurant might be worthwhile. We didn't do it but the view is amazing. 8. Stay in Durango, CO - a great town with affordable lodging and restaurants but you may want to book in advance.

There are guide books available that offer information about several of the sites. We started out on Wetherill Mesa, where the museum is not. Step House is a self-guided tour, on a slightly less than a mile loop. Long House is a ranger-guided tour and requires purchase of a $5 ticket (per person) at the Visitor Center. Both narrow trails feature an elevation drop (what goes down must come back up) and switchbacks and stairways, so they are not handicapped accessible. Also note that the elevation here is around 7,000 feet; if one has breathing issues, you may wish to visit the area by driving the roads and viewing from the outlooks. Spruce Tree House is on the other mesa, behind the museum, and is worth a look from the viewpoint, even though one cannot currently walk down to it; there is rock fall danger that has the area closed off. In a previous visit, I drove the Mesa Top Loop Drive, which shows \"the full range of architecture at Mesa Verde, from the earliest pit houses to the latest cliff dwellings.\" (Quoted from the Mesa Top pamphlet, available for a minimal charge at the Visitor Center). On this loop tour, you can see examples of dwellings dating from AD 1300s to AD 600. In any case, lots to see. You could easily spend two or three days or more taking the available tours, much less exploring the area. Or, as we did, try to hit the highlights in a day. Definitely no less than a day.

I went to the park to obtain my senior National Park Pass as it was something that had been on my to do list for way too long.(However, I believe this particular park will soon no longer sell the senior pass.) Another friend had gotten hers there a few days before I went, so that is why I went. It was such a beautiful day that after we got our passes, my friend and I decided to take a little walk. I was so impressed how beautiful it was along the paths and so enjoyed reading all the historical markers along the way. I definitely want to return to this park when I have more time to do the walk and read more of the historical markers. I would think it would be a great place to take children to get some exercise and get a history lesson at the same time.",

Finally a shop owner confided that a local ordinance spearheaded by one person made it ILLEGAL to sell bottled water! What do they do for people when it's hot?! There are no water fountains.

Tourists, save your dollars (and thirst) for Lexington or the National Park areas where you are legally allowed to buy a bottle of water!

Ketchikan is the SALMON-FISHING CAPITAL OF THE WORLD people . . . and instead of going salmon or halibut fishing, or watching loggers compete, or just enjoying the quaint town, we were TRAPPED FOR 4.5 hours on a boat! The biggest regret of our entire 10-day cruise was the trip to Misty Fjords (all 20 agreed). If one is dying to see them, take a plane trip instead (1.5 hours and you get to see a volcano).

It might be more magical on a misty/rainy day, but at noon on a sunny day in August, it looked mostly like a set of mountains covered in trees.

We were too far away to see the eagles and seals up close, but one can make out the shapes if you tried hard enough. I really wanted to see a whale, but no luck that day.

A nice size parking lot is the start of the trail head that leads to the \u2018well\u2019. It is a paved loop that ends in another section of the parking lot. Although the large cratered area looks more like a pond won over by the algae, don\u2019t let that make you turn around. Admire the modest cliff dwelling, probably considered prime real-estate in its day, and then take the path of stairs leading down from the ridge and walk a very short path to the well itself. There is a small house like structure that contains the well. A different side path further along the paved pathway leads you down some more stairs to a shaded area where the water exits and the actual irrigation canal can be clearly seen. Even a leisurely stroll to all the stops along the way, shouldn\u2019t take you more than an hour. I would not make this a destination in itself, but if anywhere in the area, it makes a wonderful stop to stretch your legs, learn some history, and dip your hands in the cool 76 degree water. There was a small building where I guess a ranger is normally stationed, but it was closed up tight when we were there.",

Originally an underground cave - that is, after the even larger shallow lake that covered the whole area - the roof finally caved in and formed what we see today, a pond - actually a limestone sink - fed subterraneously, with a swallet thruogh which water keeps draining out into Beaver Creek. From the parking lot visiotrs walk upa short cemented trail to find themseves at the rim of the more or less cuircular pond with the vertical sides, into which cliff dweeelings were built by early native tribes - what a location: always enough water to keep the crops alive, shade, trees, and tranquility supreme. The short loop trail half way around the well - with a side trail down to the swallet and some if the cliff dwelling ruins, down to beaver creek past some more Pueblo-style ruins up above, and back to the parking lot is very easy to negotiate. It's an extremely pleasant and peaceful place to visit, not overrun by tourists. Admission is free, donations welcome. If you're in the area, this is very well worth your time for a brief stop.",

The Visitor Center will do a wonderful job reminding what you already forgot from history courses. What most first time visitors would miss, because of time constraint or lack of preparation, are the wonderful hiking trails within easy reach at Jockey Hollow. If you enjoy the Eastern woods, please invest $1 to buy a trail map and choose your course(s), perhaps with a little help from the local rangers at the Visitor Center. Most trails are clearly marked and pretty obvious, even beginners couldn't get lost. Most are rated easy or moderate, depending on the elevation you might have to scale. Spring and Fall are best, even the summer should be comfortable enough with the canopy of tall trees providing shades. Dress according to weather and terrain, and bring plenty of water. I highly recommend the Grand Loop, which courses around the perimeter of the park, crossing streams and ponds besides the magnificent foliage, ca. 5.3 miles, and could be completed within 3 hours. Experienced hikers could do in much less time. History & Nature in one package, you can't ask for more in densely populated Jersey!",

Military on active duty and seniors (62 and over) get a national parks pass (any park attraction) for free which entitles them and their guests to attend parks for free. The Ford Mansion is enthralling. Most rooms are blocked off and you can peer in to see period furniture. See the rooms that Washington is reported to have used, see servant quarters, and see the two rooms where the widow Ford stayed with her children while Washington and aides were encamped there. The mansion once stood on 200 acres of property. Step back in history with this tour. Park tour guide was very knowledgeable and fielded many questions from our group. There are only a few mansion tours each day and attendance is limited. Be sure to get your ticket right away to avoid being shut out on the mansion tour.

Both of these sites have enourmous vistors centers that quite frankly aren't being used to the full potential. Then you take a place like The Battle of Princeton and there is no visitor's center except for a couple of plaques and monuments. The Battle of white Plains in New York has one small little commemorative stone in the corner of a city park. Anyway this site is ok to view a historic house that Washington lived in for 6 months. $4 for adults but free for children. The museum is free but only contained 3 exhibits that were just ok. There is also a half hour movie that is ree. We had a good time with family but agree that the Park Rangers could use a few lessons on customer relations.

For first time visitors, we recommend driving up to Paradise station, and stopping along the way at the other various lookouts and stations. My wife and I stopped SO MANY TIMES to take pictures and there are far to many lookouts to name here. The drive to Paradise Station is the one of the most beautiful we've experienced. It ends a little more than a third of the way up the foot of the mountain (almost 6000 feet), and that's where you'll find the bulk of the tourists. There's a lodge, caf\u00e9, bathrooms and other small exhibits labeling the parts of the mountain with various informational displays. Its pretty cool, actually, and certainly helps to offer a place for tourists to eat, rest, or wait out bad weather while on the mountain.

Highlights of the day included hiking at Paradise (there are many trails at Paradise, for all levels of skill), trail to Myrtle Falls (also at Paradise). The meadows were in full bloom, and you are hiking so very close to the mountain; it was simply beautiful! Be aware that you are hiking in high altitude; going up steep trails is exhausting; take plenty of water.

As we went up the walkway we looked at the flags and information for each state, which included when each became a state. That information was actually very interesting and even though I'm sure we learned that in school, and it's available on the internet, it was much more thought provoking in that setting. The monument itself was awe inspiring and huge! How they did it back then is amazing. There is a $10 parking fee because the parking is managed by a contract company. It's an annual fee, which we didn't need, but if you want to go back, you can with no additional fee.",

Of all the pictures I've seen of the Memorial the faces appear HUGE in nature. Not the case in real time. Since this is a National Memorial, you must pay to enter the grounds, either with cash or use your National Park Pass, (we used it at Devils Tower, too). However, if you do pay, you may leave and re-enter all day. The parking deck is located within easy walk to the main entrance. There were two Port-O-Potty's located on the top parking deck, but nice, government facilities are located a short three minute walk towards the Memorial. The walk up to the viewing area is impressive with all the States represented with columns, along with their state flags, on either side of the walkway. Now up close the Memorial is a site to behold from the viewing wall. Between you and the Memorial is the amphi-theatre featuring the nightly presentation of \"light's out\" and folding of the colors by our Vet's. Halfway in, along the walkway, is a concession area as well as a bountiful souvenir shop. Our hour and a half visit was enjoyable and a check mark placed in the box.",

It has each state's flag and the year it was added to the union. The flags are alphabetical order by state name. They have walking recorded tours. There's a cost for those. I didn't walk them, but there appeared to be walking trails alongside the mountain. We went in the afternoon and left to come back for the lighting. We got there at 8 and it slowly started filling up around 8:30. The ceremony is just a ranger talking and a movie about the monument. It was not all it was hyped up to be. Although seeing the monument lit up at night was really nice. After the ceremony the traffic was crazy, which was to be expected. The history of the monument is all over the place.

I arrived at about six in the morning and though there was a sign that parking was $10 there was a note posted on the parking attendant booth to simply proceed without paying and enjoy Mount Rushmore. I am not sure if parking was free that whole day or they just get someone in the booth later on to collect the money during regular business hours. I greatly enjoyed the huge sculptures of famous American presidents and the path that wound through the ground and afforded differing views on the monument. This stop was one of the highlight of my trip out west. It may not have the same appeal to other folks but I thoroughly enjoyed every bit of it.",

The Presidents Trail loop was great--I would recommend you take it clockwise as it's easier on the knees and a little easier to get through if you're not in the best of shape. Plenty of shade and benches to rest along the way and some great picture viewpoints that you can't get from the main viewing platform. Once you've completed your loop don't forget to pick up a cup or cone of Ice cream from Thomas Jefferson's recipe--the kids loved it--just be warned the portions are huge!

Rushmore- the drive was so calming - a big wide highway - and I drove through forests and hills - when I got to the entrance to the Memorial - I only paid $10 for a parking pass- that I could use over and over again to gain entrance for a year- the parking was indoor - then i proceeded to the walkway toward the memorial - of course I got distracted by the gift shop and bought the usual t-shirts and trinkets as souvenirs for friends and family- as I headed to the memorial the walkway had columns with each state's date of joining the Union- Delaware was the first state to join the Union and Illinois was the 21st in the year 1818- I am leaving the best for last - the sculpture on the mountain of presidents Washington- Jefferson- Roosevelt and Lincoln is just breathtaking - they look down at you with such dignity and wisdom - it is fantastic how out of a mountain in the middle of America comes this breathtaking image- the museum on site explains the history of this magnificent sight - the sculptor Borglum who had Danish roots wanted to set up this project in the Black Hills of South Dakota - he needed money so a man named Rushmore donated $5000 to help start this project - and that is why the mountain where the presidents visions are embedded is named Mt Rushmore- and this was in the 1940s - it is also worthy to note 3 million people visit Mt Rushmore a year",

Many people back home told us they were disappointed with the memorial but we thought it was amazing. This has been on our bucket list for years and we were so excited to finally get to see it, even my daughter who is 20 enjoyed her visit here. She took tons of pictures (as did we)! The visitor center was closed by the time we arrived. We walked the Avenue of Flags and of course looked for our State. Then went out to the viewing veranda on the Grand View Terrace I for an excellent view of the president's heads. It is just amazing to us how anyone could carve such a great memorial onto a side of a mountain. We got a few pictures of the local white mountain goat. We then came back in the evening to see the memorial when it was lighted. Since we were there so early in the season the patriotic program was not yet going on. I do hear that it is very moving. I'm glad we went back in the evening to see the presidents lighted but a little disappointed - I guess I thought it would be brighter. The pictures at night seem a little grainy but maybe a better camera would take better pictures. I would go back to see the program if we visited in season. Since the visitors center was closed, I made my husband go back in the morning to get our National Park Passport stamped! On this visit, we got to see the movie and walk the path to the bottom of the monument. Being a first time visitor, we didn't realize that if you take the path (Presidential Trail) to the right looking at the monument, you will have to walk up over 400 steps but if you take the path to the left, it is so much easier with just a few steps and the path leads to the exact same place. So if you have trouble walking, have small children, or are in a hurry, take the left path. I wish we would have went left and then walked down the steps! The Sculptor's Studio was closed on our visit. There is a Cafe and Ice Cream Shop onsite but we didn't go there. After getting home, we found out that they use Thomas Jefferson's original recipe for the ice cream so this is on our next trip's list! They have pet exercise areas on both sides of the parking lots - we didn't take a pet but thought this would be useful information to share. There is a parking fee - the National Park Pass does not cover this fee. I thought the fee was like $8 but I think we only paid $1. Maybe because we arrived so late in the day or maybe because it was off season I don't know. I would definitely go back this way again.",

The drive up to the monument is less than inspiring in that it is a collection of some of the worst kind of tacky tourist traps. It's really quite awful. Then parking at the monument is a bit misleading in that most of the signs direct you to what turns out to be an expensive pay lot. Also, the National Park Pass was not honored because it was a private lot. That said, the monument itself is quite impressive and the adjoining plaza is well done. When you consider the size of the figure heads and the effort to scale the mountain and perform the work, it is really well done. There are good sites for photography, however the afternoon sun was not the best for shots, morning would have been better. There were decent crowds in July but not unmanageable. For a pleasant break, I recommend the ice cream shop; the flavors are named after the presidents. Overall it\u2019s a piece of history that is good to see, but once in a lifetime should suffice.

Still marveled as to how this was accomplished in 1927-1941 time frame. Suggest you take Iron Mountain Road to access as along the way you go through some man-made tunnels and one in particular provides a view of Mount Rushmore from the entry side.

A massive larger than life sculpture depicting the faces of four U.S. presidents, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt, was carved into the rock of a tall mountain. It took nearly 400 men (mostly miners) to carve the mountain and considerable amounts of dynamite over a span of 14 years from 1927 through 1941. More than 90% of the carvings were completed using dynamite. The details were completed with jackhammers and hand chisels by the workers climbing 506 steps to its top each day. Amazingly there were no casualties. Nearly all of the mountain was carved during the Great Depression at a cost of nearly $1 million. The height of the sculptures faces reach nearly 60 ft high. Their noses are approximately 20 feet long, their eyes are 11 feet wide, and their mouths are approximately 18 feet long.",

That was an awesome way to see the whole scope of the monument [there are many overlooks for picture taking], as well as beautiful scenery of the Black Hills.

First time visitors should be advised to buy the audio tour to give a good background of what you are seeing. Take the Presidential walking tour and you will be blessed with many fine views of Mount Rushmore and you will be snapping pictures all along the way. Their gift shop is one of the best I have ever spent money in my time as a tourist. Carver's Restaurant not only gives you a view of the Memorial but offers many reasonably priced items for purchase. Keep in mind that the Memorial is free but you will be charged $11 to park in the ramp, which is just a short walk to the Memorial.",

Visiting during this insane election season really brings the comparison home as to the greatness of these past icons compared to some of the nuttier and inarticulate candidates who are trying to fill their shoes today. With that said, the park costs $11 per car for entry. That pass is good for a year. I would recommend visiting during the day and at night when they light up the faces- which is beautiful. Also, take the relatively short walk on the presidential trail which winds below the carvings and takes you to the artist's workshop.They only disappointment here was the film in the visitor's center. Not that interesting or informative - but it was free. ",

You and the kids can experience everything from reptiles to bears, Christmas villages to caves, zip-lines to sky trams. If you want skip all of the tourist trap sights and sounds, and just experience a key part of American history without the crowds, then November is a great time to go. The weather is crisp, so plan accordingly, but the hotels in Rapid City are inexpensive. There are no crowds at the monument, and you can drive through the area and experience it without being overwhelmed by all of the tourist activities. There is a $10 parking fee to get into the monument (your national park pass won't get you a discount), but this time of year you can park very close to everything (a 5 minute walk) and take your time getting some great photos of the area without having to fight the crowds for the perfect camera shot. Don't forget to experience the museum and drive around the monuments to get the profile photos from the backside. Dress comfortable, take along a good camera and some binoculars, pack a picnic lunch and enjoy!",

Following the long twisty entrance road up and up we arrived at the traffic jam entering the lot. There is no cost to visit the monument but parking is $11 per vehicle. The entire area is beautifully designed with walkways and steps leading to the promenade of presidents. It\u2019s easy to see the giant sculptures even from a distance peering at the huge crowds gathered in almost every direction. The display of flags alongside the walkway leading up to the mountain lends a feeling of patriotism. The actual presidential sculptures are simply awesome and we were busy taking photos and videos from many different perspectives. We were obliged to take some selfies even though the presidents in the background didn\u2019t smile for us. The museum detailed the history of the sculpture from idea to prototype to supposed completion. There is a wooden trail that leads through the woods up through the mountain a bit closer to the monument. A gift center is on site too allowing all to search for that ideal South Dakota souvenir. We spent about an hour here shopping waiting out a thunderstorm with everyone else. Though there are only attractions pertaining to the actual memorial here, we still had an enjoyable few hours here. There is a nightly light show where colored lights are displayed on the sculptures faces as the National Anthem plays on loud speakers. Based on videos we saw we felt it wasn\u2019t all that scenic and we left by late afternoon. Regardless of what you see around the area, it is definitely recommended to come visit historic and iconic Mount Rushmore National Memorial.",

I recommend seeing it twice: once in the evening when it is lighted and has a mystical ethereal appearance and once during the day to see its full artisitc power.

Our expectations for this attraction were not that high but we were blown away with our visit! First we discovered you must visit the monument during the day and also in the evening for their lighting ceremony. There is no fee for visiting this monument but you must pay an $11.00 parking fee. The parking fee is good for a calendar year but appears to be linked to your vehicle. When you enter the monument you walk through the flags of the states and that brings you to the amphitheater and above that you see the monument. There is also a Visitors Center with a very good short film and display as well as gift shops and a small restaurant that is very popular for their ice cream (Thomas Jefferson's recipe). You can take a hike closer to the monument either by going to the left or right. The feedback was to take the left trail(closer to Washington) as there are less stairs and it was true there were less stairs but still quite a few stairs to bring you back to the main building. Along the way you can visit the sculptor's cottage and see what the original sculpture was supposed to look like...quite different from the finished project so that was quite interesting to see. It was also interesting to see all the rocks down the mountain front that came from the demolition while doing the sculpture. We came back in the evening for the lighting ceremony and it was very patriotic and moving. We got there about 7:15pm (lighting was 8pm) and the amphitheater was starting to fill up. It was packed by the time the ceremony started and we were told by a ranger that the seating area holds 2500 people. There were a lot of people in the standing area as well. A Park Ranger did a presentation then they called all the veterans from the audience to come to the stage and they retired the colors (flag). Then all the veterans got to give their names and branches of service. Lots of patriotic music! Then the lights go on! It is quite moving and well worth the return visit! When you visit it is worthwhile to learn why the sculptor chose these 4 men to be part of this monument. It is a good reminder about the foundation of our country.",

It's simply awe inspiring to say the least. I can finally check this off my bucket list. In fact I would not be surprised if I returned. This is truly a magnificent site to behold. There is an $11 parking fee which I think is very reasonable and get this, you can return at night for the lighting of the faces and all you have to do is present the pass they give you!! (Don't throw it away or you will end up paying another $11). I will make a recommendation regarding the parking.....PARK ON THE 6TH FLOOR. It leads you right to the entrance of the memorial. The presidential trail is not that tiring as I thought it would be so you may want to do that as it lets you get closer to the faces. If you decide to return to see the lighting of the faces, keep in mind it is not instant. There is presenter in the amphitheater followed by an inspirational video all which run for about a total of a half hour. When you hear the national anthem, that's when the faces are lit. One last thing to mention regarding your visit to Mount Rushmore and this is regarding weather. If you can, take a pocket or mini umbrella or poncho with you, ESPECIALLY if you take the presidential trail. Believe it or not, when I started the trail, it was sunny. Upon reaching the Sculptors studio, the weather changed dramatically and it began to pour!!! Crazy!!! But true!!! I had to wait a while in the Sculptors Studio until it stopped.

Don't worry about the traffic to park, since most people stay less than an hour admiring the monument there always is a place to park. My advice- after paying your $11 ( good for Parking until the end of the year) stay to the right and keep going until parking area 5 which is the roof of the parking garage- it is actually the same level as the entrance and has tons of room. Much better than the first few areas which are at the bottom and require stairs or an elevator to get to the main level. Leaving from the roof is direct to the exit as well! Thank me later for the advice by giving me a helpful vote!! The attached picture was taken from the roof of the Parking garage which is the main level of the monument entrance. ",

The monument can be seen from the sinuous parkway that threads through the Black Hills, and the sudden sighting from afar is arresting. Up close, after a parking rodeo ($) and a walk up a flag-lined concourse, you can view the Faces in all their mineral-veined detail. There is a pleasant walk through the woods at the base of the monument and a decent ranger-chat on the engineering aspects of the sculpture. There is a pretty expensive cafeteria and a gift shop, in which people seemed to spend about the same amount of time (or more) as they did looking at The Faces. In Washington, D.C., there are memorials to Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, and Roosevelt (Roosevelt Island), which remind us in clear terms of their accomplishments. As a spectacle of engineering, Mt. Rushmore may do the same. Keystone SD , the town nearest to the Monument , is a tourist city of several blocks, with bars, restaurants, souvenir shops. With summer crowds, parking is difficult. We found no grocery stores, which seemed odd, since many of the tourists are staying in local cabins and RV parks \u2013 bring your own supplies, from Rapid City or Custer. In Keystone we were able to fuel the car and buy some hot dogs to microwave. Local restaurants may be okay, but we did not need to sit down and pay for another meal after the high-priced cafeteria at Mt. Rushmore.",

The nighttime lighting ceremony is really something to see and I think it's more beautiful than during the daytime. They put on a very patriotic and historical program with video and also call up all armed forces active/veterans to the stage at the end, each getting chance to introduce themselves. I really enjoyed that. They deserve recognition and the great applause they receive.

The park has mostly covered parking and areas where it is not covered. I would highly recommend taking covered parking, just on the off chance that a storm creeps up. I've been told by locals that there has been a lot of hail storms recently. Cost of parking is $11 which is good for a year, so be sure to keep that pass if you plan on a future visit. The avenue of state flags as your walk toward the monument is very nice, and the Presidential Trail to the base of the mountain was a nice walk and gave you different vantage points of the mountain. There is a gift shop, ice cream shop (highly recommended) and dining hall at the park. Plan to spend up to 2 hours at park. There is a light show at night which we were unable to witness due to the storms later that evening. The park gave me greater insight into the history of Mt Rushmore and the people that built it. After visiting Mt Rushmore, I highly recommend seeing the Crazy Horse memorial (~20 minutes away) which stands to compete against Mt Rushmore. I was surprised the park is open till late at night. During our visit in July, the park is open until 10:30pm. So if you want to forgo the visit to late in the afternoon, go for it. Mt Rushmore is less than 45 minutes from the Rapid City Airport, pretty much a straight shot. The only gripe I have is the town of Keystone that appears to exploit the tourism of Mt Rushmore. If you are driving in from Rapid City, you will pass through Keystone which is chalked full of attractions, gift shops, and restaurants. Seeing this killed the nice vibe I was having driving through the black hill national forest to the monument. Other than that, Mt Rushmore is well worth visiting.",

Short drive from Rapid City, parking fee $11, but no other $$ to visit. Short walk to visitor center and more walking if you want to. But great views from the center. I recommend taking the short walk up close. Only about a half mile and not too bad. There are stairs, and quite a few of them, but you are at your own pace with benches along the way. Sounds weird, but stop at the kids exploration area on the walk and listen to the stories told by the park Ranger. He is a native American and was outstanding. Decent food available and a don't miss ice cream shop. Of vourse lots of ways to spend money in the large gift shops.",

We felt it a bit of a government scam, anyway, the memorial is beautiful as ever. Majestic and glowing on the mountain. Much more the tourist destination than it used to be with gift shops, food cafes, etc so very busy.

There are walking trails, restaurants, ice cream shop and a really neat outdoor auditorium. The views from numerous locations in the park are awesome (many spots to take the your best selfie or family picture).

At 9pm in an outdoor amphitheater with a perfect view of the monument, a park ranger gives an interesting 20min monologue about each of the 4 presidents and a short history of how the sculpture came to life. At the end of the presentation the ranger invited men and women who were serving or had served in the military to walk up and join her for the lowering of the American flag. About 75 people went to the stage and then the entire amphitheater of guests rose and heard the national anthem. (Goose Bumps) The flag was lowered and then each person was given the chance to say their name, where they are from, and the branch they served in. WOW they got a huge standing ovation. The faces are illuminated at 9:30. The profile view of George Washington (seen outside the park from the road) is also great at night. Giving 4 stars because this is a National Park and it should be FREE! The $11 is for a parking deck that is owned by a for-profit company. Bogus!

It all boiled down to a speech, a short movie and patriotic music that played when they flipped the switch to illuminate the monument. It was nice to see but kind of boring for little kids. ",

Rushmore vista. It is so impressive to walk up and see the carvings in the mountain. All services there are clean and inviting. We ate at \"Carvers\" enjoying a Buffalo burger and a chicken sandwich and a piece of yummy pie. We ate on the outdoor patio with the 4 Presidents overlooking our meal! The lighting ceremony was cut short due to higher winds causing the movie screen to not be stable. So that part was cancelled. The Park Ranger gave a little talk, we sang the National Anthem, the lights went on the Monument and then Veterans were invited down to the stage to be honored before the flag was taken down.

We enjoyed finding the flags of those states that we've lived in and/or visited. Tons of photo opportunities. Two trails to walk, one a little longer than the other. I will say that we would have missed the museum underneath the theatre if I hadn't read before our trip that it existed. We had ice cream as a treat, and although we didn't eat a meal there the food we saw others with looked to be MUCH better quality than we would have expected from a tourist attraction. Large selection in the gift ship with expected prices, and a tent setup outside that day with $5 selections (t-shirts, mugs, bags, etc). The bookstore located inside the museum is run by the Mount Rushmore Society and had very knowledgeable staff, better quality books and better prices. We left midday and came back that evening for the closing ceremony and monument lighting. Afterwards, the park ranger asked the military personnel in the audience (past and present) to join her on the stage to take the American flag down. She then took the microphone to each of them and asked them to state their name and branch of service - very inspiring. So glad we were able to visit during the 100th anniversary of the founding of the US National Parks.",

With some restless teenagers in our party, we didn't take the time to read every plaque, etc., but we did take the Presidential Trail, which I highly recommend. The number of stairs might be daunting if you have knee problems, but it's a boardwalk instead of rocky, uneven steps, so that helps. With only the $11 parking fee for our car of seven, this was a terrific value.

A very sensible way to make the federal dollars stretch and still provide excellent facilities. The mountain is spectacular and the story of it's construction amazing.

It's named after Charles Rushmore, a NYC attorney, who visited the area on business in 1885. The mountain was originally known as \"The Six Grandfathers\" by the Lakota Sioux.",

Rushmore in both the daylight and at night when it was lit. What a moving place to visit and I recommend every American see this at least once in their life. And the ceremony at night was so moving and patriotic. At night, they show a 20 minute film on the United States and history of the monument and how they picked the faces for Mt. Rushmore. After the film, a park ranger invites all veterans on stage to help with the flag lowering at the national park. After the flag is lowered, the park ranger gives a microphone to each veteran or active duty soldier and they state their name and branch. It was so moving, both Mom and I were in tears. I just wish more people took it seriously because there were some kids running around like idiots and the parents did nothing to corral them. It was easy to get in and out, too, as there was an ample parking garage. The state flags as you entered were a nice touch, too. The whole place was just absolutely stunningly beautiful. There was a nice gift shop and also a sit down eatery. I loved this place and can't say enough about it. It cost $11 to park, however, that $11 gives you entrance in to Mt. Rushmore for the entire year. If I wasn't in Chicago, I'd visit again before year end. Great place; I loved it...but was disappointed I never saw Cary Grant climbing over the faces of Mt.

Forget that. You cannot stop and take a quick snap of the full monument. There are no parking, no stopping, no blah blah blah signs exactly where any normal passer-by would want to stop, on penalty of fines. Instead the road funnels you into an expensive parking garage operated by concessionaires who charge $11 to park a car and FIFTY DOLLARS for an RV. If I had been operating an RV I would have been mighty unhappy about that. You cannot access the visitors' center otherwise. As it was I was so disgruntled I made them tell me how I could get out completely without visiting. The attendant tried to talk me into paying the money for the best experience, in her view. How is it this is a national monument and yet you cannot access it without paying a concessionaire? I actually already had a parks pass that would have admitted me to any other national parks site, but that was of zero use. I seem to be the only person online unhappy about this. Just be forewarned.

I visited here years ago, and was shocked at everything there was to do. $11 for parking makes this one of the cheapest things to do in the Black Hills area! We spent time in the various gift stores, ate a picnic lunch on the terrace outside the cafe, viewed the monument from the platform, saw the ranger at the youth station (interesting stuff there!), looked at the exhibits, and hiked the Presidential Trail. We ended up spending probably four hours here between two different visits. One thing that sticks out in my mind as a negative; in the bookstore is an elderly gentleman signing books. He, Nick Clifford, was a driller on Mount Rushmore and is the last one alive. We made the mistake of walking past his table and my son merely touched one of the books as he passed. We smiled at him and my husband asked what it was like to have worked on the monument. He grabbed the book away from my son, and snarled, \"We were just glad to have a job.\" With this he just glared at us; it was such an awkward moment we didn't even know what to do. So we kept on walking. I was actually relieved to hear him snarl at someone else a few minutes later so I knew it wasn't just us. I really felt like his sour attitude detracted from our experience. Why have him there if he is a bitter, angry man? Really too bad--my husband and I shook our heads about him for days afterwards, and the fact that he gets so much space in my review exemplifies how much of a lasting impression he had. That one experience aside, it is a very humbling and wonderful experience. Don't miss the Iron Mountain scenic drive, catching a glimpse of the four heads framed perfectly through the last tunnel..... Beautiful. ",

If you like history it's interesting. We proceeded to walk up the avenue of flags, then stopped at the grand view terrace. Here you are looking straight at the Monument. Below you is an amphitheater and visitors center. We decided to continue around the presidential trailhead path, getting haIf way about 1145. The path which is accessible is wide and very easy to walk and stop on. This path at this half way point brings you right under the monument. From this point the path changes to stairs and is not accessible. Using a three wheeler, I rode back while my family went ahead on the stairs. When back to the view terrace, I took an elevator down to the visitors center and access to the outside amphitheater. I listened to the rest of the audio tour and my family got to me around 1230. They said the stairs were up and down; going both directions. As a group we went into the visitors center. Lots to do. Gift store, pictures on display, a 15 minute video & Rangers desk. We watched as kids answered questions for the Rangers and were then sworn in as Rangers; badge and all! We ate lunch in the large cafe located before the avenue of flags.Very reasonable! Another large Gift store close by. Ice cream shop too. We were out to our car by 2 pm. We returned that evening for the lighting of the monument. A must! $11 for parking all day.",

I still wanted to see it, so we made it the main purpose of our road trip. The first time we went was during the day. It was pretty amazing to A) Stare into a piece of history, and B) Reflect on the time and effort that went into creating such a piece of art. The exhibition hall was really interesting as well, tons of great, interactive exhibits outlining the creation of Mount Rushmore from beginning to end. I would have to say skip the gift shop, unless you're DYING for souvenirs. It was full of screaming children and the same tacky junk you can find at any other tourist trap. The ice cream however, was delicious. Definitely go for that. In the same trip we came back a second time to see the monument lit up at night. There is a photo in the gift shop of the big dipper over the monument and I thought maybe it was photoshopped to make it a little more spectacular. Turns out, it wasn't. The big dipper was actually visible over the monument at night. My only regret is not having a camera that would adequately capture the image in the dark. While it's definitely not an all day kind of stop, it's worth checking out on your way to somewhere else, or as one of many attractions to see on a vacation. Parking is $11 and the pass is good for a year. There is no other entrance fee. ",

The visitor's center is much nicer and the dining facilities are much improved. There's also an extensive gift shop.

We were at the memorial around 10:00 AM and it was already crowded. Everyone was posing for pictures or staring at the Presidents. We walked the Presidential Trail (review to come) and visited the Sculptor's Studio (read the history and see the model of Mt. Rushmore). We ate lunch at Carvers Cafe (reasonably good, a little more expensive than a typical family restaurant). We only regret not returning for the Evening Lighting Ceremony (we left around 1:00 PM).",

We were impressed with the minimal amount of time that it took us to get through the gates, considering the volume of traffic was entering with us. This is not a national park where a senior citizen needs to use their card to get in, as everyone paid an $11.00 fee to park. We found several different venues inside Mount Rushmore that offered hot/cold food items that the prices were consistent with other major attraction prices. The grounds were extremely clean and well kept. It had been many years since my wife and I had been there and we were happy to see some of the trails had been developed and were easily navigated. The memorial was handicap accessible and there were plenty of personnel that were there to assist. Everything was self guided and well marked. The outdoor, nighttime presentation was pretty special. A park ranger was in charge of the presentation, which was delightfully entertaining and interesting. At the conclusion of the evening, members of the U.S. armed forces (active, retired) were asked to join the ranger on the stage in recognition of their service to our Country. It was very moving to see how many military personnel moved to the stage, under a rousing, thunder of applause from the audience. Each of the servicemen/women were given the opportunity to say their name and their branch of service, prior to the flag of the United States being retired for the evening.

It really blew us all away, and to only pay a fee of $11 to get in and park the car, to us seemed like amazing value. Watching the documentary on the making of Mount Rushmore, when you get there, as well as going through the museum, I would truly recommend, it is absolutely amazing to see what these people did to build and sculpt the monument over a14 year period, considering the tools and access they would have had available to them during the 1930s and early 1940s. We walked up the many steps to get closer to the sculptures and I would really recommend this too, although if you are not a strong walker, like my mother in law, I wouldn't recommend this as it may be too much. If you do this on a hot day I would recommend you have a hat, sun cream and water if walking the many steps to get closer as it can get pretty hot. Something that we noticed was that we arrived at Mount Rushmore around 10.00am, and it was very busy getting into the monument parking, but when we left the monument at lunch time it was so much quieter getting into the car park,so you might want to consider the timing of your visit.....midday/early afternoon may be quieter (we were there on a Friday). The other thing I would want to let people know is that we came from the direction of Keystone, SD and when we got to a section of the 385, if it is busy going to the monument, you may think people are pulled over to take photos of Mount Rushmore but they are in fact in a long line of traffic to get into the parking. So you actually need to be in this lane of the 385 to get into the Monument. However, if you get stuck and are on the left hand side of this road and can't get back into the turning lane up further ahead near where the parking is you can do a u-turn, which is what we did, and we actually got into the parking area much faster than all the cars that were banked back in traffic.....I hope this makes sense. When you see it, it hopefully will.",

        "text": "My trip was planned to specifically see Mt. Rushmore, Crazy Horse and go to either Jewell Cave or Wind Cave. The Black Hills of South Dakota are beautiful reminding me in parts of Colorado. We stayed about 4 miles beyond the Memorial so as we drove past it we were going away from it and didn't see it from the road. The next day as we were driving back west from our cabin, you could see the Presidents up on the mountain from the road. How beautiful it was for that first glimpse from a distance. Even though I have a National Park Pass, you still have to pay to park as the parking lot is owned privately rather than the Federal government. So a National Parks pass doesn't save you anything here as there is no admission to the actual park/memorial itself. It is $11 to park. Upon walking in and getting the closer view, you are just taken away by the magnificence of the sculpture. You walk along a large paved area that has posts on each side with the names of states and the date in which they became a state. There are flags of the states flying off each post . Of course, there are stores and the visitor center which you can buy your commemorative merchandise. There is also the Lincoln Borglum Visitor Center which shows a 14 minute film describing the methods used in carving the memorial. The BEST part of the Memorial is taking the President's Trail. This is an easy .6 mile walk, but there are 422 stairs. The most fascinating thing about this trail is there are stops along the way in which you can see only one sculpted President. It is a wonder to me as to how they planned this out, was it planned out when blasting and sculpting was going on or when the trail was being built was it just discovered you could stop at certain points and you would see only one of the four presidents. To see Washington by himself, it is a short walk through a cave (very short even for a claustrophobic person). At the end of the cave is an opening in which you peek through and there is Washington up close. When you get to the area where you see Teddy Roosevelt by himself, you are so close you even can see the sculpted glasses on his face. The details are amazing on each president. ",

Tip for those traveling up the mountain to go see it: if you're hitching anything be careful as it is quite a large mountain. Also, you can stop before the actual entrance and take a photo as Mt Rushmore is quite visible from 16A. Stop if you can, take a photo and turn around and avoid paying the $11 parking fee, as the view doesn't get much better close up as there are too many people also trying to take a photo.",

We stayed in rapid city which was a 20 mile drive but a relatively easy one to get to mount rushmore. First you will pay a $15 \"parking fee\" which let's them say the monument is a free attraction but really its not. You then walk up some stairs or take an elevator from the parking lot to a long walkway lined with flags and a view of mount rushmore. There are lots of people so expect crowds. The best view and picture is at the end of the walkway sp just avoid the cluster of people and move forward. Then you can branch left or right for a mile loop that takes you near the base of the monument for some unique views. It's all a wood deck path but there are a bunch of stairs going back up. At the end of the loop is the sculptors house and a nice little exhibit and there are some bathrooms nearby. That's about it for this trip. ",

While spending all of my life in the south and southeast (currently I am retired in North Carolina), I have never been further west than Memphis, Tennessee with the exception of one lone trip to Vegas. I finally decided that if I were ever going to see those sites, I was just going to have to load up my car and drive there and stop making excuses about why I should not go \"this year\". During my 13 day self titled \"2015 Bucket List Tour\", I traveled over 6000 miles and visited sites or observed sites during my travels through 21 states. Mount Rushmore was my final destination before returning home. I was awe struck walking into the site and seeing Mount Rushmore for the first time. I kept thinking to myself...\"It only took you 57 years to get here but that day has finally arrived!\" To know some of the history of this location, and the men, the time, and materials needs to complete this monumental task, I was just truly overcome with an excitement I had not felt since waking up on Christmas morning as a five year old child. The trails are easy to walk and each closer view of Mount Rushmore was just breathtaking for me. Inside the park, there are some very nice places to eat a real meal, get some ice cream, and shop at the park. There are two movies showing inside the main building that detail the history of Mount Rushmore at no extra cost. One movie about the history of the making of Mount Rushmore only last eleven minutes and is worth watching. The entrance fee of $11.00 was a steal compared to the entrance fees to Yellowstone and the Grand Tetons. I even went back that night to see the Memorial as well. I think the best time to go is later in the afternoon/evening (around 6pm) was it is still light. You can then enjoy the evening and relax in the outdoor theatre and wait for the 9pm lighting and presentation. Awestruck!",

While we didn't eat there, there is a cafe (it smelled good) with reasonable prices. We did have the ice cream (yum!). The gift shop is reasonably priced to allow for a souvenir or two to remember the visit. The best part is walking the grounds, gazing at the sculptures and thinking of how lucky we are to live in this great country founded and guided by these great leaders!

Glad we got there early to see the sculpture and take pictures because at about 8pm the fog started to roll in and by 9pm you couldn't even see the mountain. So check the weather before you go. Also the ceremony is a little long on speeches by the park ranger along with a movie about the four presidents that was very boring. Just show a movie with scenes of America while patriotic songs play and light up the mountain and it would have been much better. $11 parking fee per car load of people is the only cost unless you buy food or gifts. Lots of neat free exhibits and films about how they carved the mountain are inside nice building near the viewing area.",

The parking garage had lots of space. We arrived around 6 and wandered around the park and marveled at the amount of work this took and also at the actual size! We ate in the Carver's Cafe (not great--see review), and then headed for the amphitheater for the lighting ceremony. Rain was threatening, but thankfully it held off until after the ceremony. The ranger in charge said they might have to speed up the ceremony if rain came. He spoke a lot about Lincoln, there was a 20 minute film that was interesting, the monument was lit (pictures of the lit monument looked like a blob of light), veterans went to the stage to take down the flag and introduced themselves, and we sang the National Anthem. It was a nice ceremony, although the Lincoln part seemed to go on too long, especially with threatening weather.",

It is advisable to view the video about the monument first as it will give you an understanding of its history. There are rangers at different points in the park offering talks about the monument. Information on times of these talks are posted on a board outside the main building on the right as you enter the grounds. I highly recommend the $5 ($4 if you ask if there is a senior discount) audio tour as it was extremely informative. It is to be used on the Presidential Trail, but you actually could rent it and just sit and listen to it to gain more information. If you listen to it all, it lasts about 2 hours. However, there are several opportunities to skip parts that expound on information already given. The left side of the Presidential Trail is closed for construction, so the route now is up the right side and then back down the same side. There are 225 steps, but the walkway and platforms in between help with the hike. There are some interactive displays in the museum for children. The last remaining living worker on the monument, Don \"Nick\" Clifford, is often in the gift shop selling his question/answer book. His wife was accompanying him when I was there. They both seem more talkative when you purchase the book which is $12. She pointed out that 400 people are listed as having worked on the monument. In actuality, there were only 137 people. The government insisted that all people who worked on the work programs set up by Franklin Roosevelt around the country were also listed on the plague commemorating the workers on Mt. Rushmore. Interesting. There is an obviously located ice cream shop onsite. Among the flavors is Thomas Jefferson's ice cream recipe. He was the first maker of ice cream. It is a rich, smooth, delicious vanilla flavor. I highly recommend trying it. Though I did not attend, there is a 30 minute patriotic program and lighting of the monument from 9:00-9:30 p.m. This is an amazing national park.",

It is virtually impossible to give this memorial anything less than an excellent review. Nestled in the sacred beauty of the Black Hills, the four heads of America's most famous and recognizable presidents stare over the vast landscape of one of the most beautiful places in the country. Photo opportunities are plentiful, and if you are lucky you may catch a glimpse of some of the local fauna such as the BigHorn Sheep or a Mountain Lion. The Park Rangers are knowledgable and willing to help and provide informative insight. There are several bookstores on sight to quench the thirst for history buffs and a decent sized gift shop. If you are traveling to the Black Hills this is the \"must see\" attraction. For frequent visitors, the $11 parking pass is good for the entire year so it's definitely worth it if you live within driving distance and visit the Hills a few times every year.

Other highlights included seeing the New Jersey flag and the plaque that stated it was the 3rd state to enter the union, the view from the mezzanine of the four Presidents, The Presidential walk which gives you a closer and different view of the sculptures, the Gutzon Borglum Museum which was his workshop, the Rushmore museum below the mezzanine which is an interesting history lesson and eating ice cream that was made from Thomas Jefferson's original recipe.

And the views are just absolutely amazing. There is a nice restaurant (cafeteria style) on the property. Movie buffs will recognize it from the Hitchcock classic, North by Northwest! Food is average and a little pricey, but still okay. There is no entrance fee for Rushmore, but rather just a parking fee of $11....more than reasonable. Wonderful gift shop! I had a blast in there; it's very large and has everything you can imagine in there! Great place to go into to get out of the wind for a while. There is a beautiful museum and a film.

You do have to walk a little distance to get to the visitor center but has great information. If you don't want to walk and just see Mt. Rushmore it can be viewed from numerous locations along the highway. Leaving the part we took the scenic route back to Custer, SD and it was the most curving road I have ever been on but very pretty. There are several tunnels on this route and if your going towards the Memorial every time you exit the tunnel the faces are right in front of you. Please be advised that the parking garage is privately owned and you do have to pay a $11.00 fee to park, if you park use the top level as it takes you right to the walk away to the visitor center.",

They did ask all the veterans who have served to come down at the end for recognition, and they then went down the line and each person announced their name and line of service.

But dig into the history of WHY those four were chosen. That's the hidden gem here. For example: Why Theodore Roosevelt? We know the other three, but why him? It's important. The memorial is free, but it costs $10 to park even a motorcycle. They have to raise money somehow. Ice cream shop serves Thomas Jefferson's personal ice cream recipe. Several buses of people dropped off and crammed into the line, so we didn't get to try it, but we heard it is good. Even with large numbers of people visiting the monument, you can get to the observation deck easily, and kind strangers will take your picture for you. Look, this is a \"been there, done that\" venue that you have to check off the list. It's pretty cool.

I cannot say enough about the audio tour! Not many tourists were using the audio tour but it was so worth the $5 fee! There is a lot of walking if you take the Presidential Trail. My recommendation is to go to the left of the carvings so the stair climbing is less intense. If you use the audio tour, you will go this route. The film in the visitors' center is excellent to begin the tour. A private company operates the parking lot and there is a fee to park--about $15. We did not get to view the evening show due to weather but I wish we could have seen it. Perhaps next time? The cafeteria on the grounds was ok but sitting in the dining room with the view of Mt. Rushmore more than made up for the average lunch. Lastly, the employees at the Memorial (audio tour window, the gift shop and the cafeteria) were very friendly and helpful!",

The walk up is grand, the viewing balcony, sculptors studio and the 1/4 mile Presidential walk around loop is a must. You can get so close to the big stone sculpts now it's wonderful. And the informative talk in the sculptor studios is well done, not overly long and I learned things I had never known that is fascinating about Rushmore. I wish they would show a running loop of the movie about Rushmore in it's theater or museum. That would be awesome. Nothing showing when my niece and I were there for over 2 hours. The cafeteria is a rip off and the food is so-so at best. Stay away from the ice cream. Looks great, everyone has one, but for $5 bucks you wonder how you can screw up ice cream. I wouldn't eat there if you don't have too, but the dining area in view of Rushmore is just too tempting. Try to bring something and eat there.

The history lesson is much more about the sculptor Gutzon Borglum & the how & why these four Presidents were chosen than the Presidents themselves. I was surprised to learn that several models of the sculpture were envisioned & Mt. Rushmore was not really carved but constructed by dynamite blasting, honeycombing & bumping.

Go to the Badlands or visit the city at the bottom of the mountain or go deep into the black hills instead. Only worth seeing if you're already in the area. The camping grounds surrounding the monument looked awesome.The drive up the mountain was better than Mt. Rushmore, 16A or 87 are great drives. $14 to park? No thanks, see if from the roads. If a concert (or event) was held here, it would be awesome. Then it would be worth the trip. Understanding this review could get some heat, it is a great American Monument. I'm saying it looks just as good on the history channel.",

You get some great photos inside the national memorial that you can't outside. There is a trail that you can walk to get different angles of view and photos. They do a night viewing also that was neat to see. Inside the main building you can watch a video about the sculptor and carving the monument which was very informative BUT if you stay for the night viewing they replay a video that is almost exact to it. Surprised by that but still great to read the information boards, watch the video, and see this awesome creation with my own eyes.",

        "text": "My third trip to Mount Rushmore was as moving and memorable as the other times. In fact, I erred on my first visit when I telephoned the Natianl Park Ranger and inquired about the best time to do photography. He told me that the morning light was the best light for good photography. So I scheduled a night's stay in a Rapid City hotel with the idea of doing a photo shoot the next morning and then moving on to my next appointment. Unforunately, it had rained heavily and when I drove to Mt. Rushmore just after sunrise, the mountain was fogged in! I could see nothing but gray clouds. On THAT trip I left disappointed and a wee bit frustrated. SO, plan on staying at least two nights, because I am not the only person who has never seen the sculpture because of fog in the mountains. Nevertheless, this recent visit was very special. The staff was cordial and the National Monument is neat, clean, well maintained, and well staffed. When I purchased an autographed book in the book store, the clerk thoughtfully advised me to go to the upper level gift shop where Mr. Clifford was greeting visitors and signing books. The 93-year-old man was one of the workers who \"carved\" Mount Rushmore. What a treasure he is and what a pleasure it was to meet one of the original workers on the very site where his contribution made a lasting, historic impact. My only reservation about visiting Fushmore had to do with extreme costs of hotels in Rapid City. The cost of overnight accomodations was nothing short of greedy businesses gouging visitors during peak season. Of course the winter months are subject to such harsh weather, business probably drops off dramatically. Clearly the summer months demand a high return to ensure a profitable year for all the businesses in Rapid City and surrounding areas. I am a huge proponent of capitalism, with supply and demand controlling prices, but $300 a night for a $120 room is gouging! To resolve the problem, we drove about an hour away and stayed at the Circle View Guest Ranch overlooking Badlands National Park. Mount Rushmore is a Mecca for American families in the summertime and it is an impressive monument honoring Roosevelt, Washington, Lincoln, and Jefferson. It is a grand, aesthetic feat in the Black Hills and one that should be experienced by every American who has a penchant for history. While it makes for a magnificent road trip, do your homework so that you are prepared for dreadfully inflated hotel prices that will break your bank unless you are well prepared for the cost ahead of time! Allow at least a full day to see the mountain, in the event that weather clouds your view.",

Right as we started down the path, a mountain goat walked out in front of us to fill up on some of the vegetation which made for a great photo opp and naturally our kiddos loved seeing some wildlife up close and personal. Making your way around the walking path gives you other opportunities to get closer to the monument and provides great opportunities for photographs if you're into photography. Otherwise, it's just a nice walk in nature somewhat away from the crowds. There are quite a few steps but it's well worth the time...plus then got to see the Compressor House and the Sculptor's Studio which was really interesting and full of great history. Lastly, the park rangers were super helpful and friendly. One of them gave us all a QR code which linked to a great app about Mount Rushmore that gives you some behind the scenes look at the memorial. All in all it was a great day and worth the trip!",

I will tell you this though, in person it looked smaller than what we had imagined it to be based on photos you see of it. Take the little walking path. There are some great photo spots. If you have time, take the tour too. If you have younger children, there is a Junior Ranger activity that they can participate in (might take an hour or so) and at the end they receive a Junior Ranger badge and a \"swearing in\" ceremony. Our son loved that and it is something that he'll remember for a long time. The restaurant there is nice. Kind of cafeteria style. Not a great value for the money, but, if you are hungry, let's just say that it will fill the hole.

We got the usual pic of the monument and then walked the trail to get as close as we could. So glad we did! The trail is strenuous and not stroller friendly with all the steps! There were bathrooms, benches to rest, and places to get a drink if you needed it. When we left there we planned on going to the Crazy Horse which is just a few miles away. On the way there is a place to stop and get pics of Washington's profile! So glad we went that way! I'm 45 and this was my first visit. I'm so thankful I got the opportunity to see it!",

We could not stay too long and we wish we could have viewed some of the events in the amphitheatre. Not very crowded at all but I believe we beat the peak season by a couple weeks.

The drive to the Memorial was beautiful, the parking convenient and the area well-kept and clean. There was a bookstore and food on the site. The walk-way was easy for people with mobility issues. It led straight towards the mountain, giving you plenty of ways to set up your photos, and was lined with state flags. I would have liked to have seen it the way it was before they put in all the concrete, concessionaires and $11 parking fee (your national park pass is not honored). We didn't take the opportunity to do so, but I understand there is a trail that takes you closer to the monument. There is seating on an upper level over-looking an amphitheater below. After sunset, a park ranger came out on the amphitheater stage and began a video that was part history lesson, part flag-waving rah-rah. The video concluded and he droned on and on about how we must put aside our differences as a country and come together as one nation. Huh????? I didn't expect to be chastised on my vacation! What a downer! Finally, they turned on the \"spotlights\" so that we could dimly make-out the faces of the presidents. What a let-down! Not at all what I expected and not something that I'll visit again.

The sound in the amphitheater is crystal-clear. Like other national parks, the ranger talk is excellent. I suggest taking a basic pair of binoculars to help see the detail of the monument carving. We also went back the following day and did the walking tour in the morning daylight (the path isn't lit at night). Rent the audio guide for $5. It has over 20 stops and provides and incredible amount of information and is well worth the price. Admission to the monument is free, but there is a one-time fee for parking (we paid in the evening and just had to show our receipt the next day).",

Recommend the movie to help explain the memorial, and also do the Presidential Trail walk (only a bit strenuous on the uphill portion). The walk gives you views of Mount Rushmore that are not available from the viewing platform. Did not get to see the lighting ceremony (nightly at 8), but am told it is very impressive and patriotic.

The only thing that still bothers me and always will, is the FEE that they charge to park!!! It's supposed to be a FREE monument / memorial but you have to pay $11 (2013) to go there!! What a horrible political move that was. They were building the new plazas and parking ramp when I was working in the Badlands in 1995 and I wrote several letters to the superintendent at Mt. Rushmore about it and was told that the then $8 parking fee would be dropped once the ramp was paid off. Well, now it's $11 and there's no end in sight. I guarantee that Mr. Borglum is rolling in his grave at this travesty to charge people to go to a \"free\" memorial to the four Presidents he took the last 17 years of his life carving. The guy at the entrance said that our $11 parking pass would be good for ONE YEAR, but on the back it says that it expires at the end of the year. They really need to get their act together on this, for those of us who might actually be back more than once a year it's really bad PR for those who run this otherwise breathtaking and mind-blowing carving.

We arrived early, around 8:30 AM, which was great since it was not yet too crowded. The day was absolutely beautiful - clear blue skies (after a storm with hail and a small tornado the day before!), The carving and the overall facility is spectacular. The artist's studio is very interesting as is the walkway of flags. Entry is free, but parking is $11 per car which interestingly is good for a full year! The parking ticket has the date and most of your car license plate number on it, so if you wish to return, maybe at a different time of day (or dusk) or another day, parking is free IF you save your initial ticket. Access and viewing is easy although there are a fair number of steps down (and back up!) to the studio, but it\u2019s worth it. My only slight disappointment is that the actual carvings seemed a little smaller than I expected,, but yet it was spectacular and well worth the trip. I highly recommend it.",

First if you buy an annual national park pass, this park does not honor that for entry. Their \"claim\" is that they don't charge for entry only parking and its an \"independent company\" that collects the parking money, so even though its a national park you will pay $11 to get in even if you have the annual park pass! While we were there it was packed!! The kids exploration area was closed, so we were not able to do that. And, without paying extra for the \"tour\" Most of what you could do it hike around and take pix. By the way .... You can see a GREAT view from a pull off on the road coming in to the park and there are a lot of free places to hike while driving around the parkway roads. The only reason I can even give this a two is that there is a little movie you can see telling about Mount Rushmore and I've heard if you go at night it's fun to watch the lights, however we were not going to be there at night, so we were not able to enjoy that.",

There is no fee to get into Mount Rushmore, but there was a fee to park ($11.00). From the entrance, we walked through the Avenue of Flags, which was quite nice, with Mt Rushmore as the backdrop. We visited the Visitor's Center, where my son got a booklet to fill out to become a Junior Park Ranger. As we walked around, we found answers to the questions in the booklet. He then filled in the answers and turned it in to the Park Ranger at the Visitor's Center information desk. My son was then given a certificate & a badge & sworn in as a Junior Park Ranger. He thought that was awesome! We all enjoyed the information and displays at the Visitor's Center. Also, we walked the Presidential Trail, about as close as you can get to the mountain. I got some great pictures! The trail has ALOT of steps. The Sculptor's Studio was nice as well. I was very happy that there was a vendor table set up when we were getting ready to leave the monument that wasn't there when we came. The table was set up as a \"Guest Appreciation\" day and all the items on the table were being sold for $5. So we were able to score some Mount Rushmore t-shirts & coffee mugs at a great price! We were at Mount Rushmore about 2 hrs and as we were leaving, people were pouring inside the entrance. We were happy to have beat the crowd and people were waiting to get our parking space!",

A person can just go and look and be satisfied or spend hours here. We went down to the sculptor's studio which involves going down and up several flights of stone stairs, but it is manageable for most. At the studio, a guide gives about a 15 minute talk on the history and making of the mountain. It is well done and not tedious. We then walked the trail that views the other side of the mountain (to get a better view of Lincoln's face). There are many vantage points from which to take pictures, both on and off the property. (I think my husband got them all!) There is an $11 fee which, when paid, is valid until the end of that year. This is a must-see if you are near the Rapid City area.",

If you are going to walk the trail I will make a suggestion; when you are facing Mount Rushmore go to the left and start the trail that way. You are going to be climbing stairs and if you go to the left there is mostly climbing down stairs. If you start at the right when facing the Mountain you will be doing a lot of climbing up the stairs. Also, if you have small kids and are walking the presidential trail don't bring a stroller. You will end up carrying it up and down stairs which will suck for you. We saw a couple doing this and felt so bad for them. Stop in the Sculptor's Studio on the way back up.

I'm happy to spend the money to keep the upkeep of the park. If you don't want to spend the money, you can see the faces from Rt. 244, but I think it's totally worth going into the park. You can use the pass for up to 1 year, so if you decide to go back a few times during your stay, as long as your have your pass, you don't have to pay again. Something to keep in mind.

Instead, we took our time on the walking loop (both directions can be a bit strenuous with the steps, but we would recommend starting the trail by going to the right since stone steps seem steeper than the newer composite steps that you'll encounter the rest of the way), and then perused the large gift shop.

Take some time and view all the different areas in the park to see the figures. The lighting ceremony for me was a must. We went two nights and the better place to see is the seats above the auditorium by the elevators, just not the first row. The best place to hear is on the auditorium floor. We got there by 8 to get to our seats, the ceremony started at 9. We looked around a little while my husband saved us seats. The highlight of the lighting ceremony is the retiring of the flag with the veterans or current people serving in the armed forces. The lighting ceremony was very informative and patriotic. Make sure you view the movie, see the sculptors studio, and walk the presidential trail. If you have kids the must do is the Jr Ranger program, my 10 year old loved it. My fourteen year old also did it. You have to get the book from any ranger anywhere in the park, and when you complete it you take it back to any ranger. The ranger will ask them a few questions and then they take an oath of a ranger and get a badge to wear. A great program and it focuses the kids on learning something other than just looking and not learning! The park spends a lot of time on the making and history of Mount Rushmore, which is all centered around Borglum. As you make your way around the park and the exhibits you really start to feel the passion of Borglum and what he wanted to do. The park also has a great gift shop, one of the biggest and best in the area we saw. The ice cream shop was ice cream, nothing special. The food was good and not overly priced.

There was a video about the making of Mt Rushmore, which was very interesting. And there was also a museum with various exhibits that were interesting to our entire family. The gift shop was very big and had plenty of souvenirs to pick from. There were also trails available to explore, but we were limited on time. I think this is a must stop for every family!!!!",

Upon walking up to the monument viewing area, there are state flags lining the way. It gave me chills, seeing all the flags with the Presidents faces in the background, not to mention it is a great photo op. There is a walk around the grounds where you can get several different vantage points along the route. It is actually quite breathtaking to see in person. I didn't do the audio tour as I didn't realize that was an option when I was there. My only criticism is that there is not a film to view during the day. You have to go back at night to see the film at the lighting ceremony. I went to the lighting ceremony. When I got there, fog was completely covering the monument. For about an hour, it lifted right around the faces. A few minutes before the ceremony was to start, the fog covered it again. The ceremony began with a 20-minute film. Just as the National Anthem began, the fog lifted and the faces were lit up. It was spectacular and I highly recommend it, even if it is a foggy night! You never know what will happen.",

Although we had a National Parks Pass that gets us into national parks for free, we did have to pay $11 for parking. We had our dog with us and since he couldn't accompany us to the actual monument, he had to stay in the car. I suggest parking in the lower level of the garage with the windows mostly open to keep your pet cool (leave fresh water for him too). My husband and I walked the trails around the monument and even a few trails outside of the official monument area where we saw mountain goats in the distance. At night, we returned for a special salute to veterans accompanied by video and the lighting of the monument at night. The park ranger asked all the veterans to come forward and selected 6 (my hubby included!) to retire Old Glory for the evening. It was an exciting day to be part of such iconic America.",

Better, fewer tourist filled photographic shots of the monument are to be found on the wonderful road to Custer Park from Keystone. Frame the faces through the forest or through a stone car tunnel.

The sculptures themselves are very simple. The artist did not use of many traces to make his point. Reminds me of Egyptian sculpture actually. Their eyes impressed me the most.

The Presidential Trail is a must too. It gets you much closer to the monument and boulder field and affords you a number of less-cliched photo opportunities. We arrived a little before 7:30 on July 15th which gave us plenty of daylight to walk the Trail and be in our seats by 8:25 for the 9pm night-lighting program. If you want a decent seat, get there by 8:30. Like a movie theater, the prime seats are in the middle and upper areas. You probably don't want to be right at the front, and that's what was left by 8:45. The program featured a brief talk by a ranger (including reciting the Gettysburg address), a video about the four presidents, the lighting of the monument and the retiring of the flag with the help of all the active and retired military members in the audience (which was a really nice touch).

Headed to Mount Rushmore around 10am. There is no entrance fee but parking was $12, which is valid for the calendar year, so keep your parking pass for a followup visit in the evening. Parking was not a problem, albeit a little walking involved. The visitors center is nice and staffed by pleasent folks. As you approach through a walkway edged with each state flag the magnificant memorial comes into view. It is quite astounding and worthy of many photos. We took the Presidential trail, which is a nice walking trailing affording various views of the memorial, many photo opportunities along the way. Hint, take the trail in a clockwise direction for less uphill climbing. The walk is easy with many rest stop benches along the way and if taken in a clockwise direction you are doing more walking downstairs than up. Take the time to visit the artists studio towards the end of the walk.",

We drop off the bags and headed over tot he memorial as it was becoming dusk and at the memorial they have a lightning ceremony where as the sun sets and gets darker, they off lights and tell you the history of Mt Rushmore. As they finish up -they ask everyone to stand and join in with reciting the Pledge of Allegiance and then the monument is light up starting from the bottom. Visitors try to gather around the stone edge to look down into the amphitheater to see what is going on there. As much as this might be interesting, if you want good pictures, hang back a little for pictures. As for Carver's Cafe, if you want a snack then grab a bit here before it closes.

There is a small charge to park at the monument ($11, for a car), but the actual admission is free. You can see the monument as you get closer to it while driving which kind of makes it less exciting when you arrive. The memorial looks just like you expect it to look. There is a nice easy to use walkway that circles the area with information about the monument and different view points, but you can't really get that close to the sculpture. We stayed for the lighting ceremony and while I thought the presentation was nice I was expecting much more. It was a cool sight to see, but once you've seen it I don't know if you'll ever need to go back (I know I won't). There is a cafe with typical cafeteria foods (burgers, chicken, etc.), drinks, an ice cream shop, and a gift shop. Everything is overpriced but that should be expected. If you really want to visit Mount Rushmore I recommend spending a few days in the region so you can visit other attractions.",

Don't get me wrong, it is still amazing and definitely worth a visit. On this trip we included the evening program at Mount Rushmore because we had heard that it was very beautiful with the monument lighting ceremony which was begun at 8 P.M. Actually, the entire ceremony lasted about 90 minutes. It started with a history talk by the ranger at the beginning, then the lighting ceremony & patriotic music, and lastly, a call for all veterans to come to the stage to be recognized by their name, rank, and service affiliation. As you can imagine, this took a long time. There were many families with young children & I think they were getting a little antsy by the conclusion - if you have young ones, I would recommend leaving before the vets portion of the program. The monument is free but the cost of parking is $11.00. Be sure to remember where you parked your vehicle - yes, it took us a while to find ours! If you go at night, I would recommend staying nearby in Keystone as it was about a 30 minute drive in the dark back to our Rapid City motel.

The smell of pine trees is wonderful. Then onto the Visitor Center. $11 entrance fee was well worth it. Lots of parking (several outdoor levels). Then a nice walk up to the main plaza. There's a very long row of flags for every state in the union. A great gift shop and cafe. And the sight of the presidents up close is truly breathtaking. Just the sheer human achievement of actually getting something that huge and detailed carved into a mountain side is truly awe-inspiring. I couldn't stop looking at them. Don't miss it.

I would also suggest if you go in the summer to buy what is known as FROGG TOGGS. I found mine at Bed Bath and Beyond. Read how to prepare the cooling cloth. This is a neck wrap in a plastic bottle that you wet and wear when you get hot. It saved me from over heating and kept me cool. If you are older take the steps slowly and walk slowly and rest often. Take water and drink as you go. The walk in front of the memorial is worth it. The beauty of the landscape is unreal. You see pictures and movies of Mt. Rushmore but you just can't appreciate how huge and wonderful it is until you see it. You will pay for parking only and they have covered parking which we liked for keeping our vehicle cool.

We decided to see it at night and arrived around 8:30 for the 9:00 lighting ceremony. Many others arrive for this as well, so plan ahead if you attend to see this. We didn't get there early enough to get a seat at the auditorium for the ceremony. The experience at night would be best if you get a seat to see the movie that accompanies the speaker. We did not and it made the speech harder to follow without seeing the screen, especially for younger children like our 5 year old. While it was nice to see the mountain at night, the detail of the faces is better appreciated by day. We came back the next day to take it all in completely. The walk at the base of the mountain is easy and gets you up a bit closer. Overall, its worth the stop, especially for only $11 for a year, and for me makes me feel all the more American. Its an American Icon that shouldn't be missed if in the area.",

You get a really great breakfast for $5.99 (The Monumental Breakfast - eggs, bacon, sausage & gravy and potatoes) - can't beat this deal and it was good! My other tip is right inside the entrance you can rent a hand held device for $5 and hear all of the background information as you walk the Presidential Trail.

That aside, the setting is beautiful, the layout of the walkway, visitors center, shop and restaurant, as well as the Flag Walk. One cannot help but be impressed with the work done, and the dedication to detail on the faces of the four presidents depicted. It was really inspiring. We decided to have the grandchildren participate in the Jr. Ranger Program. If you are not familiar with this program it is well worth the time (no cost) and the kids really learned about the site. I wish I had thought to take down the names of the Rangers we spoke with, who went over the kids booklets, gave a little pop quiz (our five year old grandson, when asked by the Ranger who was the president with the glasses, proudly answered \"Teddy Roosevelt!\" to the pleasant surprise of his mother). The Rangers we spoke with were pleasant and well versed in the information about the monument. The gift shop had lots and lots of items, although a few items that would be what a 2/3 year old would like, would have been helpful. Overall it was a fascinating and thoroughly enjoyable experience...and rather emotionally moving as well.",

It is only a short 20 to 25 minute drive out to the Monument from Rapid City. It is truly an impressive place to be. Parking was $11.00, but there is no fee for touring the monument, grounds, studio, and museum. Happy to pay to park as the entire place, including the parking was paved, clean, neat and user friendly. The only problem we encountered was that we were a few weeks early for the busy tourist season. Some of the area attractions and the sculptor studio at the monument were not open. We visited during the last week in April. Mount Rushmore is truly an attraction that everyone must see! Make a time and go see it! We went back out to the monument in the evening. The faces are lighted about 15 minutes after dusk and remain lit until about 9:00 pm. Wow, what an impressive place. We enjoyed every minute of our visit. Allow a few hours for the visit and wear good walking shoes so you can take the President's Trail. It is about a 1/4 mile walk with some steps to negotiate. It is worth the time and effort. It will put you right up under the faces for some uniqe photos. Nice lunch room and gift shop on the site. Over a million visitors a year. You should be one of them!",

Buses don't start arriving until mid morning. You will be charged $11.00 to park however the entrance to the monument is free. Fees of this type charged by concessionaires under contract with the National Park Service is slowing ruining the publics perception about the Park Service. The other concessions, such as the gift show , are also tun by large corporations determined to get your last dollar and many times providing a cheap , shoddy imported product as a souvenir. There is a gift shop and cafeteria on the grounds, plus a theater that will give you the story of the construction. The gift shop has numerous books about the monument and unless you just have to have the book at once, I find jotting down the name and ISNB number and waiting until I return home and make the purchase off of Amazon where I save 30 to 40 percent off the retail price. Plus I don't have to lug that book or books around for many more miles. The little town Keystone is located just down the road and there you can get a cup of coffee or maybe a sandwich.

Mount Rushmore, while one admires the original feat of carving it, is surprisingly dull. The area of shops at the entry are tacky, parking is expensive and there really is no payoff once you have walked out on to the viewing terrace. Photographs and postcards make it seem considerably more dramatic. Crazy Horse will, one day, have far more impact. It is far from completed however, and the $10 per person entry fee seemed more akin to a donation to the project.

We started on the easy side and then thought that the difficult side would be fine because it looked to be all downhill; however, it does climb again and can be difficult for some.

Definitely walk around the wooden walkway and most people should be able to do the loop--maybe a mile [guess] when it's all said and done and mostly level so not really physically demanding; some stairs here and there so I think handicapped folks would be somewhat limited in making the entire loop. Get some good vantage points from nooks and crannies of the fellas on the hill and the trail leads you over to the small museum where there is a video of the construction and a mock up of some equipment. All told two adults can swing the whole thing in 90 minutes including taking pictures but do that stuff during the day. Come back later at night using same parking pass, grab some ice cream and bring it out for a good seat for the evening lighting ceremony. There was an excellent movie that last 20-30 minutes around dusk followed by some narrative from a ranger [and a song actually], and at least on our night the ranger asked veterans to stand and be recognized then come down to the platform for retiring the Colors.

We did a loop hike parking our vehicle at Kachina parking lot. We started on the Mesa trail which is pretty level to the Sipapu trail which is steep and leads down to the Sipapu bridge by stairs, ladders then followed along the canyon/dry stream bed (not marked very well)to Kachina bridge. From there we climbed out of the canyon by stairs which are pretty steep. It is 5.6miles total. Or you can continue on to Owachina bridge for another 3 mi which we were too tired to do! We are not athletes or young so it took us 4 hrs. The views of the bridges from the bottom are impressive! Bring lots of water. If you prefer not to hike you can drive the park loop and stop at the viewpoints. Or hike up and down to each bridge. The park was not crowded and we saw no one else on the loop we did.",

I think the length of RVs is limited to 28 ft. The campground is spotless with very clean bathrooms. Maintenance people are there working all the time, making certain this campground remains presentable and appealing to every guest. No water available at the campground but you can get 5 gallon of water per day from the visitor center. Short path goes from the campground to the visitor center. From my tent I had a great view of Bear Ears. There are several areas with recycling bins and trash bins. Each site has a tent pad, grill and picnic bench. It is $10.00 or $5.00 with senior pass. The drive to the campground from Blending on route 95 is visually spectacular with many Indian Ruins and some of them are right off 95. The signs point to them so it is obvious where they are.",

The North Unit Visitor Center is located near the park entrance about 11 miles south of Watford City on US 85. A short film gives an overview of park history, geology, wildlife and things to see. Scenic Drive winds 28 miles (round trip) along the cliffs, outcrops, coulees and canyons formed by the Little Missouri cutting into colorful bands of rock. There are numerous pullouts to view the rugged landscape and rock formations. The cannonball concretions are particularly interesting, and are adjacent to the drive. Wildlife abounds, particularly early in the morning. There are numerous bison, elk, pronghorns, longhorn cattle, feral horses, mule deer, prairie dogs, and hundreds of bird species. Four trails, Achenbach, Buckhorn, Caprock Coulee and the Little Mo Nature Trail thread through the park. I enjoyed the Caprock Coulee Trail which starts in the bottomlands along Squaw Creek and ascends to the caprock plateau near River Bend Overlook. It traversed grasslands and forest habitats, and offered spectacular views of the badlands along the river. The Little Mo Nature Trail starts near Juniper Campground and the picnic area. It is the least strenuous of the four trails, and has interpretive information at numbered stops. Oxbow Overlook, at the end of Scenic Drive is the starting point for the north and south Achenbach trails. It rained during my visit, and the ancient volcanic ash layers became quite slick (like ice, only not so flat). If hiking, wear sturdy shoes, carry food and water, and be ready for sudden changes in weather. Bicycling along park roads is a great way to see wildlife. You can canoe, kayak or fish in the river.

In late October and early November the drive offers some of the best fall foliage in the south. Year round, the drive has RV and primitive camping, day use picnic areas, and a scenic turn-out almost every mile.For the more active, the Ouachita National Rereation Trail offers 225 miles of \"easy to moderate\" hiking between Talimena State Park in Oklahoma to Pinnacle Mountain State Park just west of Little Rock, Arkansas. Trailhead parking and primitive campsites are located about seven miles apart in the section of trail that follows the ridge of the Winding Stair Mountians. There is a $3 fee to camp, but you have free access to the showers in the adjoining RV parks. If you want to \"loop\" back to your car, you can take the equestrain trails down through the Holson Valley.Plan a stop at the Queen Wilhelmina State Park atop Rich Mountain in Arkansas. Just east of the Okla/Ark state line, this park has something for every member to your family or group. In addition to RV and tent camping, the lodge and restaurant offer food and accommodations, there are many children's activities, and several easy nature trails. Both the senic drive and the Ouachita Trail pass through this park. Reservations may be needed in the summer or fall. Call (800) 264-2477.Don't overlook this section of the country. You'll have to get off the d... interstate, and it may \"cost\" you a day, but it will be well worth it. After taking the drive, you may want to enjoy the local lakes, museums, and other attractions in the area. ",

Good videos in the center, helping you learn about the first planned industrial city in America, born of Hamilton's vision and powered by the Great Falls, about one of the last and greatest Negro League Baseball Fields to remain standing, part of our sad history of segregation and the gifted athletes who transcended it, and about the Falls themselves. The Passaic River has a seasonal ebb and flow, and if you catch it at the wrong time, the Falls are a dribble. But at the right time (and today was that) it has a magnificence that rivals Niagara, but in a smaller, enclosed space. Quite amazing and beautiful. The Park Service has made progress, in concert with the town, to try to clean it up, though you do still see some trash. So not pristine, but a complex interplay of major American industrial history, social history, and ecology, all in a wondrous waterfall.

Spend the 10 minutes to see the film, then another short visit to the museum. It gives you the whole historical context of what you are about to see. They give you a nice plasticized four page trail map explaining the well marked feature points, which you return when done. Very concise and helpful. Then you can either do a pleasant 1.2 mile walk from there, or if you have less time, a short drive to the park HQ lot,which puts you right next to the remains of the Spanish church. Then you do the loop, through the church and adjoining pueblo ruins in a little less than a mile. Great vistas of the area. The pueblo was built on a high point and existed as a trading point to the western plains for milleniums before the conquistadors showed up and undermined their world. This is not a pueblo site built into a cliff. This was a free-standing four story pueblo occupied by two thousand people. What is left are excavated remnants of foundations and rooms, and several well preserved underground kivas you can actually climb down into. Well marked paved trail with signs giving the history and details. The second church remains are the best preserved, albeit worn away by the weather, the first much larger church having been destroyed in the Pueblo Revolt of 1680. You look at the surrounding mountains and valley below and feel the history and the lives of those who lived it. A special place. Worth the trip. Ps. It only costs three dollars for an adult to visit.",

As I recall, it's just over a mile in total, but it was not a difficult walk. If you can't walk the whole trail, there is a parking lot at the end of the trail (not near the visitors center). Pay your admission at the visitors center and then drive around to that parking lot. Most of the ruins are very near that lot. The Rangers and volunteers in the visitors center are very helpful and friendly. Here's the plus- your leashed dogs are allowed on the trail. We had a very nice hike in the sunshine with our furry family members. The ruins are beautiful and you can even enter the kiva (no dogs allowed there!)

Much of the old (second) mission church is still there, and at least one of the underground kivas has been rebuilt. There is another section of the park a few miles away at Glorieta Pass, where a crucial battle of the Civil War was fought, that ended the South's westward expansion. Again, you need to review the displays in the visitor center to appreciate that battle, because there isn't much out there to see otherwise.

If at all possible, try to visit the park at a time when you can take the tour. Cathy really knew her stuff and opened up the history to the place. This was all the more important since much of the ruins have not been excavated. We needed the interpretation to bring it to life. (I think that they do have a written guide if you\u2019re not visiting when a tour is on offer.) Visualizing the intense trading culture that would have characterized Pecos was pretty powerful. The most significant ruins in terms of physical presence, as elsewhere, were those of the mission church. (Very similar to Quarai at Salinas Pueblo Missions National Monument, yet different by virtue of the surrounding landscape and the specific history.) After the tour, I watched the 10 minute video in the visitor center, which had I arrived earlier would have been better before the tour. Still worthwhile. I also visited the museum which had a great historical pottery display along with excellent informational placards. (I felt that this visit complemented, rather than duplicated, a visit I made to Salinas Pueblo Missions National Monument.) Altogether I stayed a little over 2 hours.",

I went through Lake Mead National Park, Grand Canyon and here and converted it all to an annual pass for any visit to ANY National Park for one year! SCORE! I took 6 hours to drive through here with my daughter because we like to hike all the trails and visit the visitor centers which were all very informative and helpful!

It is a National Park Service location and is full of information, tours, and great knowledgeable folks. I was pressed for time so I did the \"Boca Negra\" trail. It takes under an hour and you can see hundreds of petroglyphs. What's a Petroglyph you ask? It's old art! It's drawings on black volcanic rocks made by Native folks hundreds, if not thousands, of years ago. The view from the top of the trail is also a wonderful vantage point to see a panorama of the city and surrounding hills. It's well worth the $1.00 parking fee too park at the base of the trail.

We started at the Piedras Marcadas Canyon trail, which (I believe) gives the best opportunity to see the most petroglyphs, and you can get very close to them. It's also all sugar sand trails, so it's a good workout! After that, we tried the Boca Negra Canyon hike. That one is all uphill, but entirely paved. There were not as many petroglyphs, but there were still a lot! (This site is shared by the city, which maintains the parking lot, so you will have to pay $1 to park there.)

Wouldn't you know the day before my visit, I fell down the stairs, sprained my ankle, and scored myself a brace and a pair of crutches? I didn't want to miss out on the park, so I went anyway. I will say that if you're on single crutch, you can see a fair number of the petroglyphs. You won't be able to make it to the top of the Mesa Point trail in the Boca Negra Canyon, but you will be able to see most of the Macaw and Cliff Base Trails. The NPS estimates that it'll take about 50 minutes to see all of petroglyphs, and there is a picnic area with water fountains and restrooms in the area, though I'm sure you'll want to make sure you have plenty of water with you especially in the summer months. Petroglyph DOES participate in the NPS Passport program, so don't forget that and any parks passes you might have. If you forget, not to worry; Boca Negra is just $2 to park on the weekends, $1 on the weekdays. As for the other areas to include Rinconada Canyon, Piedras Marcadas Canyon, and the Volcano Day Use area, I can't comment on, as I simply was unable to hike much on foot. At any rate, my recommendation is that if you can't spend the whole day at Petroglyph, at least check out Boca Negra, take some photos, and drink often. You'll enjoy checking out historic and prehistoric imagines drawn in stone.",

It is a large scattered area, and the Visitor Center is nice, but it is not where you go to see the Petroglyphs. The most concentrated area of petroglyphs can be found in the northern most section of the park, the Piedras Marcadas Canyon area. There you can take a scenic 1.5 mile hike that has a great collection. Bring water and hiking shoes, as you may do a little climbing to see some of the petroglyphs close up. We were really impressed and spent over 2.5 hours on the trail. There are a variety of lizards and insects and jack rabbits in the trail area. Pay attention the directional signs are small. There is also a lot to see in Rinconada Canyon area on a slightly longer trail.",

The 5 & 15 minute walk were much more my speed, but in the end they were all very interesting for our children. If you can find the canyon - there is really no need to go to the visitors center unless you want a bit more history (you can watch a 20 minute movie and buy souvenirs). The only fee is a $2 parking fee at the canyon. Cheap and interesting way to spend a few hours away from the city (which is maybe 10-15 minutes away). ",

It was snowing and wet so some of the petroglyphs were obscured but I still saw a bunch. The path is circular, with the second half walking through fields but I would recommend backtracking the way you came in. I did and saw a few symbols I had missed coming in. I went next to the visitor center. Chatted with the nice ranger. I think her name was Alison, but I am probably wrong since I am terrible at names. Got my passport book stamped and continued to Boca Negra Canyon. $1 entry. Unfortunately, this is not a place to go when it is raining/snowing as the trails are a kind of cement/blacktop that I found to be slippery. I started up the hill of the one trail-saw what was my favorite petroglyph-it looked like a weasel holding a lollipop-but even in hiking books felt a bit unsure about walking. There are several other trails by the restrooms and I was able to see several over there without climbing up anywhere. In good weather this would be a great place for an afternoon visit.

One way is to take Central Avenue west to Unser Boulevard and head north. Stop first at the Visitor's Center to get a map and chat with the park rangers who have a ton of information. After getting our map, we headed a little further north on Unser Blvd. till the turn-off for the Boca Negra Canyon section of the Monument. There is a $1.00 per car parking fee. There are three hikes here. The first will require a little bit of a hike up the volcanic outcroppings. You will see petroglyphs all along this trail. This is not strenuous but it is uphill. It's strange to see how close the housing developments are to this part of the Monument. From the top you get a wonderful view across the Rio Grande Valley. The second is a level hike through an arroyo (which also leads to the rest rooms). This is a short stroll on a sandy path. The third hike is a little longer, on the other side of the rest room building. You will see petroglyphs up-close. We saw lots of little lizards and many flowers were just coming into bloom. Very neat. We then drove into a residential section of town (north and east of Boca Negra) and found the parking area for Piedras Marcadas Canyon. Again, this was a stroll through sand and sagebrush to see more petroglyphs on the canyon walls. And again, you are quite near the housing development that abuts this part of the Monument. Because Rinconada Canyon trail was closed because of major damage from a storm in the fall of 2013, we drove north and west to the Volcanoes section of the Monument. There is no sign pointing you to this part of the Monument but it is very near the little airport that is across from this part of the Monument. There is paved road that leads to a parking area and rest rooms. You can see in front of you at least three very old volcanoes about a half mile walk across the grassy flatlands. You will be walking on some of the lava that spewed from these rift volcanoes about 150,000 years ago. We climbed close to the top of one of them for spectacular views of the Rio Grande Rift, the Sandia Mountains to the east, and the Rio Grande Valley directly in the middle. Awesome views!

The view from the top was awesome, and there were several signs that told us what petroglyphs we were looking at, as well as more information about the volcanic rock. It gets pretty hot out there, and there's not much in the way of shelter. We did find some graffiti written on a rock; however, the ranger had already told us what was real art and what was not.

The hikes to the petroglyphs are easy, but good hiking boots, sunscreen, windbreakers, hats and water make for a much more comfortable experience. If you are not a walker, you probably won't like this attraction. Much of the trail is sandy which increases the effort required. Take a good camera, and be sure to stop at the visitors center, talk to the experts, and pick up a map and information sheet that describes the various glyphs. Kids LOVE this hike! Give yourself at least half a day and have fun. PS: $2 parking fee at trailheads.",

There are several trails available of varying lengtghs and difficulties. There is a trail for everyone - one was literally a total of about 30 yards while another was a 2 1/2 mile hike through the desert. All of the trails are interesting and you are virtually guaranteed to see petroglyphs at them all. It is very interesting to scan the rocks, locate the petroglyphs, and think about someone carving the figures in the volcanic rock long ago. It provided a pretty cool connection to the past and I thought it was well worth the visit. Be aware though that this is a fairly low-key activity and people with little to no interest in history may actually find it boring. The only cost is $1.00 per vehicle. As several others have noted, this exhibit is outside IN THE DESERT so it is usually HOT. Take some water, wear a hat and some sunscreen, and enjoy the petroglyphs and hikes.",

Make sure to stop at the visitor center just off Unser Blvd on Western Trail. The Park Ranger in the visitor center will give you some great information on Petroglyph's and even recommend where to go. He recommended that we go to Boca Negra Canyon a few miles north of the visitor center. Parking was $1 and at the time we went there were plenty of parking spots. In Boca Negra there are 2 \"mountains\" with 1 main trail at the first stop then 1 main trail and 1 small one at the second stop. Both have parking so you can drive over after the first stop. Each trail only takes about 30 minutes max but you can spend more time searching out Petroglyph's if you like. You start by climbing the volcanic rock and looking for Petroglyph's, you actually acend upwards a decent height before you come back down the looping trail. The park service is trying to start a cell phone information line where you call a number and at different locations they give you interesting facts about what your looking at. I tried it and it was pretty cool but unfortunatley its still in a test phase, hopefully they'll improve on it as I rather enjoyed it. My kids had a great time and had no problem climbing the trails.

At $2 per vehicle, you can't beat the price and it provided a couple hours of fun and history for our family. We didn't see any snakes, but there were signs warning you to beware.

When you enter the park you must stop at the small visitor's center to pay the fee and get a map from the rangers. The rangers working when we were there were incredibly friendly and very helpful. They want to make sure everyone is safe on the trails so visitors can enjoy themselves. If you are prepared, you have a fantastic selection of trails to choose from, but if you want a nice starter trail, do Bear Cave and the Rim Trail. The park warns you need a flashlight for the cave, which is obviously great advice, but I used the flash from my camera to see since we didn't have a flashlight and we were okay. We didn't go deep into the cave as they were closed for the bats. This park is beautiful, but be prepared with water and food so you stay safe.

First one was clear waterfalls which is about 6 miles from the entrance off north of Brevard on Highway 276. You can walk down and take advantage of the water below the Falls to walk in or float if you'd like, the only problem is it's Rocky and a rough bottom to get out there period I would recommend some kind of water shoes to protect your feet and a good sense of balance period what are those called even though it was mid June. Access to the water is not a simple walk most of the lock slope down towards the river period but the waterfall is beautiful and great place to get a good picture and some Adventure. II waterfall was sliding rock which is about another mile and a half up the road away from Brevard. This is the recreation area and is a $2 charge per person to get in. The bathrooms and dressing rooms are available however there was electrical problem and they were closed during our visit. We walk down to the fall area and took a look at the Rocks while sloped and slippery they are certainly not smooth. Despite that I was intent on giving it a shot the only problem is the Wiz rain in the area and as soon as the lifeguards heard thunder The Falls are shut down for 30 minutes. The Thunder continued on for another 15-20 minutes so we decided to just get a picture of the falls head back to Brevard and wait out the Storm Passing. I must say the people who were doing the sliding we're having a good time and everybody all ages and sizes was involved so if you get the chance to visit the forest take the opportunity to see Sliding Rock at least and give it a shot sliding down into the little pond at the bottom of the falls. Just make sure you have a towel and some dry clothes and hopefully they have their electrical problems solved",

First we climbed up to Fryingpan Mountain Lookout Tower, a 70-foot-tall structure built by the US Forest Service in 1941. The ascent was steep but short, and climbing the actual tower brought us to a splendid view of all the surrounding peaks. Later we drove down to Sliding Rock (which charges $2 per person), where the more adventurous of us loved the thrilling ride down the gently sloping waterfall into the cold pool. The next day we hiked up to Black Balsam Knob, perhaps everyone's favorite mountain hike ever because the trail allowed us to see the mountains all around us all the way to the top. It was cool (on a very hot day) and very windy, and the 360 degree views were spectacular. We carried sandwiches up with us and ate lunch at the grassy top of the bald mountain. Amazing and unforgettable!",

We were camping but it worked out well, Just be sure to keep your tents on the gravel or paved areas. The shower area is fairly new and kept cleaned. The only issue is that there is just 1 shower stall so at peak times you may wait awhile. At $19 a night it makes a trip very affordable,",

It is by far nicer than any campground that we have seen in the Great Smokies National Park or on the Blue Ridge Parkway. If you are a hiker then you got to hike the 1.5 mile trail to Mount Pisgah where Channel 13 TV tower is located, The trial is a little streunous at the end but we did see people from ages 4 to 70 up at the obervation tower. The view from the top of Mount Pisgah is incredible and worth the hike. Buck Springs trail is another trail worth checking out! Mr. Vanderbilt of the Biltmore House had a hunting lodge there in the early 1900's. We also went to the Crade of Forestry and were skeptical of the $5 per person fee but we spent the day there and thoroughly enjoyed it. You will learn so much about the history of forestry at the Cradle of Forestry. You will find plenty of things to do in Pisgah National Forest!",

Took time to stand and stare at the waters.....turtles and magnificent variety of fish all to see. The lava is amazing, creating many tide pools teeming with interesting animal life. Oh and then there's the game of Konane. When you get to the visitor center, ask for the instructions because it's fun to actually sit and play the game. Really interesting game of strategy. Combine all this with a stunning location ..... Have fun!",

Be prepared for a no beach snorkle experience. I found that having my beach shoes on to travel across the lava rock was key. Once you are out at the edge, there are a couple different spots you can enter the water. Mostly use the steps down in. There are no pokey urchins there and it can be a little tasking if the waves are rough. Sooooooo much sea life! Once you are out, there is no place to stand up. That took some adjustment on my part. This is not a first time snorkelers place. I would recommend some of the beach parks in Kona for first timers before they come here. This is the ultimate snorkeling experience.",

It is an easy path to walk that shows you hales (houses) as well as a variety of tiki style idols surround by a great wall that marked the grounds and the foundation of a heiau (temple). This truly is a place of refuge. Entrance fee is $5.00 a car load, or $3 per person. I highly recommend coming and walking this beautiful place and feel the peace and \"mana\" of the land. You won't get a full history lesson of this place and its history and culture, (I suggest you read up on it before or even after). Don't hesitate to ask any of the Park Rangers questions, everyone I spoke with was eager to answer all questions; they just were constantly in your face. This is a self guided tour that you do at your own pace.

Start at the Visitor's Center where you should see the 30 minute video in the amphitheater which is a great overview of the park and it's ancient history. The park was once the sacred grounds where Kamehameka chieftains were buried and the great king Kamehameka was born. It's a sacred site so learn what you can and can not do on the property. It is also the place where refuge from war or refuge from death could be secured after Kapu sacred law was violated. If you could make it to the refuge before you were captured and killed for your crime, the high priest could grant you life and a second chance. The rangers give free talks at (10:30 and 2:30) and further explain this very interesting culture. While at the visitor's center pick up a free map which shows you the 16 sites to visit. Site 8 is the rebuilt temple. The 1871 Trail of Ki'ilae is 2 miles round trip and begins right behind the visitor's center. A guided tour is also available which is ranger led and lasts about 40 minutes. Kids can get a Junior Ranger Badge which will keep them occupied. You can also take a self-guided tour. When I visited there were green turtles laying on the beach. Actually they are not green, only their flesh is green from eating seaweed. They said pods of dolphins and sometimes humpback whales are visible from the shoreline but I did not see any. Tide pools are teaming with marine life and are worth investigating. They have a native Hawaiian demonstrator on site that does native crafts like dug out building. Tip: engage them because it will enrich your knowledge and experience. They are expected to engage visitor's so go for it. Once you establish a relationship they really begin to open up.

Pay the $5 entrance fee at the Pu'uhonua O Honaunau National Historical Park and park your car in their lot, then walk the couple of blocks to the snorkel area via the beach access road (just outside the park entrance because parking at the beach is limited). Actually, there is no beach, just lava to walk across. So, take water shoes/sandals to walk on the lava. Entrance/exit into/out of the water to snorkel isn\u2019t as hard as it looks and you will be rewarded with a spectacular view of coral and hundreds of fish! Then go back to the park (use the bathrooms to change, if needed) and take the Historic Park self-guided tour to see some amazing Hawaiian artifacts and history.",

        "text": "Before going to the Place of Refuge, take a little time to learn about old Hawaiian culture (pre-contact). It is especially helpful to learn about the class distinctions between the ali'i (royalty) and other people, and the kapu (or taboos). Then, visit Pu'uhonua O Honaunau and take in the serenity, beauty, and spiritual significance of the site. The crash of the waves, the palms growing in white sand, and the re-created village environment transports visitors to the Hawaiian past. Hawaiians who violated kapu and who were lucky enough to flee their villages alive would come to the city for refuge and absolution to be able to return to their homes. The air is thick with the spirit of the past, and it is so easy to imagine the ali'i living here and the terrified refugees seeking safety. There is a wonderful audio tour (via cell phone!) and sand-friendly wheelchairs to provide accessibility. I would absolutely bring children here - there is plenty to look at and enjoy, and, bring your National Parks Pass for entry. Take your time, and watch the beaches carefully for turtles. (Moving rocks? Yeah, they're turtles...) We combined our visit to the Place of Refuge with a snorkeling adventure at Two-Step (my favorite land-based snorkel site). But please, don't use the Place of Refuge as a launch site for the snorkel adventure. The two experiences are very, very different. There is road-side parking for snorkeling, and the restrooms at the Place of Refuge aren't changing rooms.",

Redwood National Park is not just one park which is a combination of many state parks and there is no park entrance fee. The best way to explore this park not just only driving through it but also do some hiking. There are some short ( o.5 mile) to medium ( 2-3 miles) hikes which are not difficult to handle. To me the best part of Redwood is at Stout Grove (0.5 miles loop trail) which you can get to it from Cresent city or north entrance ( like us). But the road is narrow and with big holes. Do not forget to stop at visitor center which they will give you some ideal where to go. We drove through Newton B Duruy Park way ( you will see the biggest tree at this region) and went to Fern Canyon which you can do more hiking ( narrow road and curvy with big holes and string of water to get there also). At Prairie Creek ( before go to Fern Canyon) you will be able to see many many elks ( I saw at least 14 of them). At Humboldt Redwood you can drive through Ave of Giant. There are couple hiking trails. We hiked at the Chaney memorial Grove ( 2.4 miles) which is loved by local. At Ave of Giant you will able to see the tallest tree at this region. ",

We then we did the cathedral trail and you can't take a stroller on that but we did anyway and had to carry our baby and carry the stroller, as it has inclines and lots of tree roots and then it narrows. My fave was the prairie creek trail. We also went to fern canyon. $8 if you don't have a national parks pass. Worth it. Just go early cuz it was so crowded when we got back to the parking lot!

We took the road less traveled into the Jedidiah Smith State park and Redwood National park. The easy way is over a bridge off hwy 160 coming south from Grants Pass. There is a ranger outpost on the north side of the road where you can get directions to Douglas Park Dr and Howland Hill Rd. However, that bridge was under reconstruction and we entered off hwy 101. We visited the visitors center in Crescent City, CA and they directed us down a short distance to the Elk Valley Road that bends into the Howland Hill Rd. Once on this road you will wind your way through these giant redwoods spaced just far enough for a single vehicle to pass through. The road is dirt, dusty, and full of pot holes but that seems to add to the ambiance. After traveling about 5 miles, you enter a parking area with outhouses and trails through the forest as well as down to the Smith river that passes through.

It was a labor day weekend, we 3 families stayed in one of Trinidad's vacation rental (Retro Retreat $900) for 3 nights, we planned for 2 but the minimum was 3, in fact it turned out to be good other wise it would have been a exhaustive trip. On Day one we just roam around Trinidad, beaches, light house, Paticks Point, once passing Patricks point there is an RV park and old school museum where they do have a community music band and free food (you can donate $$ for the food) on weekends, we had great burgers and coffee, then proceed to Gold Bluff's Beach. It's a 20-30 minutes drive through the woods, slight rough roads and small creeks you can drive through. You need to walk down to see the fern canyon and water falls which is a mind refreshing experience, I would suggest plan for an afternoon at this place. We didn't that much time so we spent some time at fern canyon and didn't reach to falls as it was farther and park hours are about to close for the day. We had a close encounter with Elks at this place. Day two we took south to visit shrine drive through tree as we didn't know there was another one in Klamath, so that we could visit drive through tree and trees of mystery in one trip.It turned out to be good as this place has few parking spots inside the park. Even though the tree is supported by the cables and it's leaned to one side. It's not a tall tree, it's a hollow tree vertically (been cut off) and horizontally where you drive through.They are saying that the trunk of the tree has been burned off and fall down ~100 ft from the level. Tree is still alive and it has leaves and branches as well. I visited the leget drive through tree as well, more or less you 'll get the same feeling as you drive through the tree, if you expecting for a fully sized tree from top to bottom, it's not what it is. We still had time to spent but not enough to reach Klamath for visiting trees of mystery. So we took a tour through avenue of gaints and swim at one of the river passing near by. You can drive in to river and park next to the water. The water was not that cold too. We spent some time playing with water, and refreshing swim. Then we visited the one of the beaches at Crescent, it was early evening and a bit cold but kids enjoyed it's fullest as the beach is more of sandy than muddy. On day 3 we went to visit trees of mystery at Klamath, we could have do both day 2 and 3 in one day if we went to Klamath on day 2. On our way back we took a stop at Carson Mansion which is a really great place to visit.",

Also stayed at Mill Creek campground: further north with secluded campsites. Bathroom facilities older, showers not as clean, and varying prices for the showers.

We liked the Yurok Loop trail and saw a bald eagle & we also did the Trees of Mystery. We drove the Newton Drury Pkwy & we did see some elk near the visitor center. We really liked the Fern Canyon trail (you can only hike it for a 1 mile loop if you want)--highly recommended but $8 per car load. We also liked the Trilium Falls Trail--we saw elk here too.

We had to park about a mile or so on the road and walk back, but it was free. The entrance fee to the forest is $5.00 per person. After paying that you can visit the gift shop, eat, drink, go to the restroom or just proceed into the redwood area. There is a whole different atmosphere upon entering the forest. It is a humbling, almost hushed attitude that the visitors have while in it. I looked around while walking the several miles that we did that day and there were people visiting from several nations. I could hear snippets of german, korean, italian, french and some indian and arabic dialects being spoken around us. After a mile or so inside the forest, there is a clearing where one can sit on a bench, reflect, take pics, etc., and where a park ranger gives a 15 minute talk on the history of the forest and how very difficult it is to grow a majestic redwood to maturity. A tiny redwood seed must go through a gauntlet of issues before it has a hope of becoming a fully mature tree. This was fascinating stuff to me.

Be sure to check that tour's days/times of operation, as we were about 1/2 an hour too late to get on the ship. There is a suggested donation for the ship tour.",

Read about it here - http://www.ssredoakvictory.com/index.htm. The tour by the docents has an amazing amount of information, presented in a personal, warm manner and if you are lucky, you get to spend time with the ship's retiring chief - Bill Jackson, aged 94 (but you would never believe it). Bill was one of the first African-American chiefs in the U.S. Merchant Marine and his story will inspire you and your children.

The road is winding & often no guard rails but it is worth every mile you travel. Get ready for blue skies, sunshine, even snow at times, mountain peaks, plenty of gorgeous aspens in fall colors. Could not get enough, every bend in the road was a picture. You can see why they call it the Million Dollar Highway.

We were there on Labor Day weekend so the trail was fairly busy but I imagine at other times (especially during the week) it is not very crowded.

We travel the country visiting and hiking America's Greatest NF, NRA, NP and NM's, so we are inclined to be excited when we get to stamp another page in our National Parks Service Passport Book. That said the Santa Monica Mountains NRA was a double whammy, because you are minutes from the Heart of LA yet you feel a hundreds of miles away. The Park has much to see and like its cousin, the Smokey Mountain NP in the east, the SMNRA is unique in that it is dotted with private property and homes. Not a problem though as this \"array\" of structures and facilities mostly adds to the stunning scenary. We really enjoyed the Semler Winery located right in the heart of the NRA on Molluhand Parkway. Open daily, we enjoyed a wine flight while sitting back and soaking in the stunning hils of vineyards. Hiking trails dot the area and every road is a scenic one. I suggest you start at the SMNRA visitors center accross the 101 in Thousand Oaks to orient yourself with the Park. The Visitors Center is located in the old City of Thousand Oaks City Hall, built in the Sixties, the City Hall in itself is a attraction. With so many stops to refer to, may I suggest Paramount Ranch. Bought by Paramount during the golden era of hollywood, this ranch was the backdrop for many classic pictures and the western town which remains was even the hometown for Dr. Quinn Medicin Woman.

Each spot had a nice parking lot and various markers telling about the action in that area. Almost all the stopping points had paved trails that you could walk on to see more of the view. And it is some view, especially overlooking the Hudson River. We especially like the second stop which was called the Neilson Farm. This tiny house was General Benedict Arnold's headquarters in September 1777. The guide at this stop, Diane, was just so much fun to talk to. She told us some information about the battle and the generals involved that had recently come \"to light.\" The driving route is about 10 miles and takes you back to the visitors' center where you can use the bathroom and purchase books, toys, souvies at the very nice gift shop.

You need to use your imagination, and it really is amazing to think about. Great for history buffs. You can spend a couple hours or all day, it's up to you.",

The road to Sequoia is a long windy road and you might want to make sure you have plenty of gas, because the hills and the curves can drink it up pretty fast. If you are Seniors invest in the National Park Senior admission card, $10, good for life for the purchaser with ID and at all parks and for everyone in the car. There are several pull overs so other cars can pass you or you can get out and check out the view. We loved the FREE shuttle buses that took you from one area of the park to others in Sequoia. Some of those roads are barely a lane and a half wide so it makes for some interesting maneuvering when you meet an oncoming car and was even hard for the shuttle drivers. We are not hikers, we are walkers and there are nice paths to get around on. The climb to Moro rock is worth all the heavy breathing, red face, and effort. That rock is so prominent on your drive up to the park, we were thrilled to climb it to the top. We did the easy way, climbed until we were tired, took a rest, let people pass us, and then continued on. Stunning views as you climb up and once you are on top - WOW!. For the hikers, there may be a trail that leads to the top by other than the stairs as two hikers arrived at the top on a very different edge of the rock than the stairs led to. The Sequoias are the stars, hard to imagine trees that are so old, so big, have withstood innumerable forest fires, and are there for us to see in all their glory. Talk about feeling insignificant standing by one of these giants. Try to catch one of the ranger talks, the one we heard was a show and tell about the Sequoia pine cones, what it takes for them open and the seed generation process. To get to Kings Canyon you drive through the Sequoia National Forest. We tried to see most of the suggested things for Kings Canyon including Raging River and Grizzly Falls which we almost missed. We had to turn around and go back but it worth it. The Zumwalt meadow is a nice little walk across a river, but it was rather buggy but were were there toward the end of the day and Muir Rock at Roads End was inspiring considering all Muir has done for the parks. There is a lot of driving in these two parks but worth it to see such such great examples of nature at its best - mostly undisturbed and its original state. There is a lot to see and do.

There were supposed to be actors telling you about life in the fort. What we found were a group of teenagers hiding in the kitchen bashing their manager and gossiping. When someone walked in, they would stop and just stare at you until you felt uncomfortable and left. A grandfather was going through telling his granddaughter all about the fort instead of the employees. The demonstrations were spaced far apart, so far that you wouldn't want to wait around for one. However, the grounds are beautiful and it is interesting to think that you are walking in the footsteps of Lewis and Clark and their company.

We spent the night after the first day in Medora at Badlands Motel and the night after the second day in Watford City at the Roosevelt Inn. We saw more wildlife in the South Unit (wild horses, bison, prairie dogs and mule deer). In the North Unit, we only saw one lone male bison, but we enjoyed the solitude of the North Unit. The Painted Canyon area was the most crowded of the three areas, since it is right off the interstate and it is free. For the other areas, the cost is $25 for a 7 day pass, which is good for both North and South Units. Compared to other large National Parks we have been to (Glacier, Yellowstone, Smoky Mountain, Grand Canyon, the Utah parks), we found TRNP even at the height of summer season to be refreshingly uncrowded. In the South Unit, late in the afternoon, we cautiously followed a male bison walking on the yellow line about a mile on the Scenic Loop Drive and not one car came from the other way the entire time and only two cars came up from behind us. In Yellowstone, this would have caused a huge bison jam with 30 cars in each direction, tourists running from their cars with cameras and three park rangers trying to keep them safe. Other than in the Visitor Centers, we saw no park rangers while in the park. Take some snacks and lots of water, even if you are just driving around and don't plan to be hiking, as there are few facilities beyond the visitor centers. You can fill up water at the campgrounds and we found one pit toilet on the Scenic Loop Drive in the South Unit. The Visitor Center at Painted Canyon has a small store and a few displays, bathrooms, and water. The Visitor Center at the South Unit has a film (we recommend), several exhibits, Roosevelt's Maltese Cross cabin, and a gift shop along with restrooms and water. The North Unit Visitor Center is just a trailer - good to stop and ask any questions, get your NP passport stamped or get a map, but not much else other than porta potties. It was very hot and very dry the two days we visited in late July; luckily, there was an almost constant breeze. We were a family of four with a 10 and 13 year old, so we mostly did the overlooks and the drives with a few walks. Unfortunately, there aren't many short hikes in either unit. We did the Painted Canyon Trail, which starts near the picnic pavilions at the opposite end of the parking lot from the Painted Canyon Visitor Center. This is a well marked loop that is 0.9 miles if you stay on the main trail, but you can make it longer by taking some of the side paths (we were on it for a little over an hour, because we did take several side paths). You start at the top of a cliff and work your way down to the canyon floor - so this is steep at the end and the beginning, but fairly flat in between, unless you choose to clamber up one of the rocky areas once down to the floor. Take water and wear a hat and sunscreen, as it can be dusty and there isn't much shade. In the South Unit, we drove the 36 mile Scenic Loop drive with several stops for wildlife and overlooks and we also took a few short walks and this took us 4 hours. The short trail to the old East Entrance Station is very flat and goes through a prairie dog town. Buck Hill is not really a trail, but a very steep walkway with several stairs to a great overlook (you are seeing the other side of the Painted Canyon from the Painted Canyon Visitors Center). The Biocourt Trial is also very short; takes you out to a point where you are looking down into a canyon. Wind Canyon is a quick loop that takes you to a point to see a bend in the Little Missouri River. In the North Unit, we drove the Scenic Drive (14 miles out and 14 miles back) mid-day and spent about 4 hours. We walked the Caprock Coulee Nature Trail (1.6 miles out and back) - there are brochures at the trail head that tell you about the things you see on the hike. Some of this trail was shaded, but most is not, so take water with you. We also did the Little Mo Nature Trail, but found this one not very interesting and can't really recommend it. We did enjoy going down to the river near the entrance to the Juniper campground (the beginning of the South Achenbach Trail) and wading in the river/mud (it is really muddy, so plan footware accordingly) and looking at all the animal tracks. There is a nice picnic area with restrooms (but no water spigot that we could find) near the Juniper campground, too. In the North Unit, you are mostly on the floor of the badlands, looking up at the formations. In the South Unit, you are on top of the badlands, looking down -- so there is a difference in the two units from that perspective.",

The Badlands of North Dakota are beautiful and much different than the Badlands in South Dakota. We were so happy that we made the effort to see this beautiful park. I am so glad that Roosevelt thought ahead and helped to make this available to everyone.

It's going to be relatively slow going because there's tons of cars taking their time so it's best not to be in a hurry. It's not crowded in the Yellowstone crowded and there are plenty of turn-outs so it's extremely pleasant. You'll see tons of prairie dogs, hopefully a lot of buffalo (although we only saw two!), wild horses, and hopefully other critters.

The ranger at the gate told us that the South Unit (in Medora, ND) had around 350 head of bison. Still, I didn't really expect to see any. We drove for about 30 minutes before we encountered any wildlife (not counting prairie dogs - they're everywhere), but the experience was unforgettable! Feral horse herds walked right up to the car, and pretty soon we were surrounded by herds of bison, so close you could reach out and touch them! It was fabulous!

The Park Service needs to get some volunteers (boy and girl scout troops come to mind since I lead a troop of 20 girls) and get this place cleaned up. I wish we would have had time even to make it up to Tortilla Flats which I heard was breathtaking.",

This would not be a great place to visit on a hot day, or a hot afternoon. I think it was in the low-80s when I was there, and that's about as warm as I would want it. Make sure you take A LOT of water and wear good shoes, although the path to the dwelling is paved. Because it faces east, I'd also suggest a morning visit for best views into the cliff/cave.

While much smaller in scale, the cliff dwelling ruins at Tonto provides into other historic people who sought to build these fascinating dwellings. One thing for sure, you are likely to find no crowds at Tonto and even may have the place to yourself. While I definitely appreciated learning about the Salado culture that lived here from around 1250 to 1450, I very much enjoyed the vigorous walk up to the lower ruin and gazing upon the beautiful views of the canyon, Roosevelt Lake, and numerous Saguaro cacti. The approximately 1 mile roundtrip walk to the lower cliff dwelling is on a paved trail that rises approximately 350 feet. There are several benches to sit and take a break on the way up. Folks of moderate excercise ability should be able to accomplish the trip up and back in about an hour. There are Rangers at the ruins who can answer your questions that you may have. The walk to the upper cliff dwelling ruin (which is about twice the size of the lower ruin) is about 3-4 hours roundtrip and is only conducted via ranger-led tours November to April (primarily on the weekends and you should reserve a spot on this trip). Entry cost to walk up to the ruins is $5 a person.

We went on President's Day and the park service was having a free admission day, but the $3 per person would have been worth it. Lovely people working the desk, we were there in time for a brief tour that starts at 11am. The guide gave us lots of information about Father Kino and the start of the mission. After that, we went on a self guided tour, with a very informative booklet of the grounds. Interesting points were described in detail in the booklet with corresponding numbers. The church was begun in 1800 and so much went on there, many people living and working on the beautiful property. Nice, easy walk through the grounds to the kiln where they made the bricks, the cemetery, the orchard. Fresh tortillas made for you, fill it with salsa and beans, no charge. You should go.",

There is also a small museum well worth walking through. We were there Easter morning and a lady was outside the Visitor Center making torillas, which was a plus. They offered a booklet to use (but return) so one can guide oneself, and that was worth it. Otherwise, it is hard to know how and when the various buildings, etc. were used. There are more preserved mission churches, but this is a nice place to stop. They also have a small museum store.

(I STRONGLY suggest the $17 per person trolley tour, which is 90 minutes and a great overview of what you might want to visit more during your stay.) The shadows of the soldiers were almost palpable, with the monuments to the various state militias and the officers that were involved in the winter over of 1777-78. There is only one authentic artifact: Washington's residence, with the reproduction spring house where he would have wine and shad (a fish he favored) kept cool. I remember visiting the park before it became part of the National Park System in 1976. It's not just that I appreciate history more. The historical interpretation of the park is far more visceral and immediate, even for a Philadelphia native, to learn why nearby towns are called Wayne (Gen. Anthony) and King of Prussia (see \"Gen.\" Von Steuben). SEPTA even runs a bus route to the Visitor's Center.",

        "text": "This is a nice piece of history. It is the place of encampment for Washington and his troops during winter 1777-1778. No battles were fought here but this is where troops were properly trained and lessons in perseverance were learned. Valley Forge is easy to get to from the highway and entry is free. We arrived around noon and went to the visitor center. Be sure to ask where the kiosk is located where you can enter an ancestor's name to see if he was at Valley Forge. We purchased the self-tour cd for $16 (I would recommend this) and then we watched the free short video about Valley Forge and the Revolution and then walked with a Ranger to a few stops for about 1/2 hour. We took a break and drove to King of Prussia for a quick lunch (a few miles away) and then came back to start the self-tour. We ended up driving around the park until 5:30 p.m. and we didn't even get out to see everything. Washington's headquarters was at a good spot for us to stretch our legs after driving around for a while. This is a beautiful, peaceful park where it seems locals come to take advantage of the great spot to picnic or exercise. We did Gettysburg and Valley Forge in the same week and it is interesting to compare the two. Gettysburg is more hustle and bustle while this is more serene. Both equally nice. In retrospect, we should have stayed in King of Prussia afterwards because this was an all day event for us and that area looks nice and new with plenty of restaurants, hotels and a mall. An overall great visit to Valley Forge.",

        "text": "We spent a lot of time at Valley Forge since it was of special interest to my boyfriend. As it was August and the weather was hot, we opted for buying the vehicle CD (about $15) and driving the park and stopping at the sites instead of one of the bus tours. The CD was quite informative and gave exact directions as long as you followed the 15 mph speed it suggested. We were ahead or behind on it but got back on track by pausing or sitting in the car a few minutes. There can be a lot of walking involved if you get out at each stop to walk around. Most areas are pretty pedestrian friendly. I happen to have asthma, so walking back up the hill to the parking area would have been asking for an attack if I had been alone, however, my boyfriend walked to the top parking area and brought the car down to pick me up. There is a cute little gift shop where you can get a hotdog and drink behind Washington Memorial Chapel, but otherwise, refreshments are pretty sparse until you leave the park. There is a covered bridge on the route that I suggest you cross and see some of the homes on that road, go as far as the park sign and turn around to come back. Some of them were used as headquarters and are not on the main cd tour but can be seen on the park service map (which you should get at the visitors center from a ranger). Overall, it was a very nice park. Most areas with buildings close at 5 or 6pm, so when we arrived on Fri and went to the park, we only had a short time to explore before things closed, but did a quick tour and went back on Monday to spend the day. It was nice knowing where things were before the deep exploration on Monday.",

We did the auto tour with 2 chihauhaus after a 10 hour drive from NC. The park is very dog friendly, the Park Rangers were super nice. The really nice thing about the auto tour was the we were in our car, with AC and our dogs. It was easy to stop at the locations, with or without the dogs, walk and do a little photography. The CD was very easy to use. A person can go as fast or as slow as they want. We also saw trolley tours and horse back tours, but they were not an option with the chi-chi dogs.

The volunteers are very knowledgeable of the history of the battle and the surrounding area. Walking through George Washington headquarters was really neat and the grounds are beautiful. If it is raining, you can stay in your car and drive around seeing most of the park without getting out. I wish I had had more time to explore but the park was closing at 5pm. It was also very windy and cold, snowy at times because it was winter but I enjoyed it all the same. Hope to go back to the area some time in the summer.

There is a well marked 5 mile trail for bikes, families with strollers, walkers, & runners. The bikes were $10 an hour and excellent quality, easy to rent. We decided to go off the beaten path. Our 5 miles turned into 15 as we kept making left turns to see what was down that path into the woods. We ended up discovering wonderful 200 year old houses & farms, maintained by the park, and completely off the beaten path. I understand why the Park does not advertise these beauties, they are not set up for tourists, but if you love old houses and the feeling of being in a place that hasn't changed in 200 years try foraging through the woods to find these spots! There are trail maps,(for when you go off the 5 mile trail), that are NOT well marked, but they do generally tell you where these spots are. We went on a glorious fall day and spent 4 hours getting a great workout.",

The park itself, even on a rainy day had reenactors onsite in the encampments and buildings to give background and answer questions. Photographs are permitted everywhere in every building ( something very uncommon anymore at historic sites due to restrictions on flash or insurance issues). The park tourguides themselves were also on hand and very knowledgable and animated in their presentations. The drive tour is free and you can access info at each stop via cellphone. Or you can purchase a more detailed driveguide via cd for about $15. Very similar to Gettysburg. Their is also plenty of areas for cycling walking running picnicking and a host of other outdoor activities. Washington chapel is on the tour but is not part of the NPS and the church charges a $2 admission fee..well worth the small donation. The architecture is fantastic and the folks providing info about the church know their stuff. Even in the pouring rain ( which it did for most of our visit) you can still enjoy the entire area. A trolley tour of 90 min is also available for a fee of $16 for adults and $12 for children. But check as prices can change.",

We arrived just after 3:00 on a Saturday so we bought tickets for the last trolley tour at 4:00 then asked for a place to have a late lunch. We were told the nearby snack shop closed at 2:00 so we were directed to a small place not owned by the park behind the nearby Washington Memorial Chapel. It was cute, full of souvenirs and home made goodies. The lady there was happy to tell us about the church as we ate our hot dogs. We made it back just in time to hear a man speaking about events in Valley Forge, much of which I had no idea. It was very educational. There are many displays in the visitors center which we didn't have much time to look at. The tour was great, there was even men dressed in period clothing who gave a gun demonstration. Very interesting. I took many pictures I will try to post later. I would say the tour was very much worth the price of $15. But i would only reccommend it for older children since there is alot of sitting and listening and no seat belts. It was a great day, but next time we will be sure to go earlier, eat before we go or pack a nice lunch, there are plenty of places for a picnic. We plan to go back in the fall when the scenery will most surely be breathtaking. Visit their website for info and coupons before you go!

There is a short movie, but our timing was off so we skipped it. You can jump on the bus/trolley (I believe there was a fee), ride your own/rent a bike, walk, or drive your car. Walkers/bikers--lots of hills!! Only stops 2 and 5 were interesting to us--#2 a series of log cabins (reproductions) that you could look into, one you can enter. #5 Washington Headquarters and Train Depot. HQ was cool--no hands on stuff though. Train depot just had more info placards and pictures--still being developed I guess. Feel free to ask questions of the characters, they were very knowledgeable and good with the kids.

We spent an enjoyable 5 - 6 hours at Valley Forge National Historical Park, which is only a 30- minute drive from the Philadelphia airport. It was a crisp fall day; the leaves were turning. The day began gray and rainy, but eventually the sun came out. We started at the Visitors Center which has a well-done museum containing artifacts from the site, and exhibits portraying the life of the soldiers during their encampent at Valley Forge during the winter of there. We also viewed a 15 minute video that was at best, average. There are lots of walking trails, and we took advantage of a loop trail that is actually paved and winds its way around the park. The loop trail is about 5 miles and winds its way through woods (we spotted a deer), across fields, and around the main parade grounds where the soldiers were trained by Von Steuben. There were no battles at the site, but it was an important staging ground for the Continental Army during the bitter winter of 1777-78. The Continental Army gave bonuses of $12 to the soldiers who could complete their log cabins in the shortest amount of time. At first we were disappointed because other than some log cabins -- most of which appeared to be reproductions of the originals -- there wasn't a lot to see. We were ready to leave but then decided to find the house at the park that was George Washington's headquarters. That was the highlight of the visit. The house was built sometime in the 18th century; much of it is restored, but there are some original parts of the house. Gen. Washington rented it from its owner. The park service guide did a wonderful job telling us about the house. If you go to Valley Forge, don't miss George Washington's headquarters. If you have young chidren, they will enjoy the \"reenactors\" who are dressed in 18th century military uniforms. Guided bus tours of the site are available for a fee. This is worth a visit if you have any interest in the Revolutionary War.",

We were lucky to emerge from the informational film just as a terrific park ranger named Peter was about to lead a tour (about 1/4 mile). The tour was excellent, as Peter led us to the beautiful ridge overlooking the Great Valley and brilliantly told all about what happened at Valley Forge during the Revolutionary War. Costumed interpreters then demonstrated how to load and fire muskets and how to bake bread and pie in the outdoor brick ovens in the camp. We then returned to the Visitor's Center to get the map for the self-guided tour and drove through the lovely park. Two great stops were the Memorial Arch and Washington's Headquarters. There are several spots to see and explore the 12-men cabins which the Continental Army built for shelter. However, the drive through the park was exquisite, with deer and other wildlife and very picturesque scenery, including a covered bridge and views across the Schuykull River. There were tons of people just enjoying the park, walking and riding bikes along the paths and trails. Altogether, a perfect late summer afternoon.

The Native American ruins are especially interesting and unique (to em anyway). Hard for me to imagine that humans were able to eke out an exisitance in these conditions.",

Otherwise, general admission here is $8. Be cautious though if you are out of condition...there are over 200 steps down to the \"island\" and that means over 200 back up. Take your time. Visit earlier in the day, especially in the winter. We got there at 3:30 and although it's open till 5, once you get down to the island the sun is below your horizon and it looks like you are running out of daylight. it's cold here in the winter, this might be a better visit in the spring or fall. I was deep breathing walking back up the steps and the breathing in the cold air was a little bothersome. There are places to sit and rest on the way back up so take advantage and get your heartrate back down. Make sure you read the warning information, because the girl at the desk didn't really tell us that it was considered a strenuous trail. Also, if you are afraid of heights, this won't be for you. There are railings most of the way down, but some little areas do not have them. However, I do believe this is the trail to take to see the dwellings in the rocks and how the community lived over 500 years ago. Amazing that these rocks are still so preserved. It took us about 45minutes-1 hour to do this trail, but we didn't dilly dally because of the impending sundown, and the place is only open until 5p anyway.",

Seeing the ancient dwellings up close was fascinating. Seeing them from a distance was equally interesting. The information and images along the Island loop trail answered many of our questions and provided a tremendous amount of information to help us imagine what life must have been like living in this rustic setting.

There are many steps going down to the middle of the canyon, so you can really see everything!!

Don't forget your water!! but they have a couple of gateraid machines if you do. AND!!! you can take your dog!! Not recommended for the senior dogs though... just saying.

The cost to enter the National Park is between $5 - $8 dollars depending on the time of year. We would recommend getting a pass for all of the local National Parks (available at all of the booths in each park) to save a little money. The cost varies again pending the season. However, this was the best $8 I spent in our week visiting Flagstaff. The Hopi tribes lived in this canyon that has dropoffs of easily 1,000 feet+, lived off the land with Prickly Pear Catcus, Claret Cup Cactus, Twoneedle Pinyon, Mormon Tea, etc. The climb is strenuous for those with physical limitations. 285 steps take you down about 200 feet from where you start at 6,885 ft above sea level, and there is a paved trail (often without railing) that extends a mile around a middle mountain that you walk to see the half wall room these folk lived in. Very little privacy they had and along the way are informational signs to help one understand the life of the Hopi tribes. If you are afraid of heights, take your time, my wife did okay but stopped along the way to rest. There are places with benches among the stairs as well.

Being a national park means this attraction is not free...but at $5 per person (adult), you'll feel like you ripping them off...especially since your fee, once paid, is good for return visits for 7 days!

The parking lot is right at the visitor's center, and it does cost $5 per person to get in. The visitor's center has some displays to explain the native dwellings, but all of them have been reconstructed so I suppose it's our idea of what they looked like, not necessarily what they did look like. The trail goes down and around a tight bend in a dry river bed and then back to the visitor center. It has concrete steps and wide flat concrete or crushed stone pathways. Be aware, the trail isn't long, only about a mile, but it has a great deal of vertical relief (280') and you are hiking at 7000'. That means you are walking down and back up a 28 story building, so leave extra time and stay within your limits. The trail along the top rim is flat and easy to walk and you see everything, just not up close. We visited on Aug 17th and were treated to a fantastic storm. We arrived at around 11:00 A.M. and had finished by 12:00 noon just as a huge storm arrived. The lightning hit in the canyon several times and the rain poured for over 45 minutes. Then it started hailing and the entire area filled with white slushy pea sized hail stones. What a hoot! I suppose it wouldn't be so great if you were out in it, but from the huge windows of the visitor center it was FANTASTIC! When the rain let up we walked to the rim and saw the flash flood in the riverbed below. Even if you don't get the weather to cooperate for you the way it did for us, you'll still love the hike.

Crazy to think about how they lived back then. You would have to be tough as nails! There's also a very tiny museum at the visitor center worth the quick walk through. There are quite a few steep stairs on the paved trail down which I can see being difficult for some people but there are quite a few benches a long the way if you need to take breaks.

Walnut Canyon was not a disapointment. For 5 dollars a person you can walk around the whole canyon (about a 1 mile trip) and actually go into most of the dwellings left on the walls of the canyon. Some places are a little steep with no guard rails but this actually made it more exciting. The hike itself was not that hard and we highly recommend it.",

You can view some from a lookout behind the visitor center or by means of an easy paved half mile Rim Trail looking down into the canyon. There is also the Island Trail which has about 240 steps (most with railings) going down 185 feet into the canyon where you can enter the ruins (many of which had been destroyed by vandals many years ago). This is strenuous on the trip back up, especially since you are 6500 feet above sea level. There is a 20 minute video at the visitors center as well as a small museum. The center is open from 9 to 5 PM daily except Christmas. There is a $5 per person fee but you can use one of the Park passes (such as Senior) for entrance. To get to the park take I-40 to exit 204 and go south for 3 miles. Note that there are no stores or restaurants nearby so if you are going to be here for a long period you might want to bring lunch, drinks and snacks.",

Learn from my one mistake and if you plan on hiking down take water if it hadnt been for the nice couple in front of me who I had stuck with for the hike Im not a 100% sure I would have made it back up. They have two trails a loop trail and a rim trail. Hiking down into the loop trail has a lot of steps but if you can do it do it so worth it. Pay attention as you are going down to your surroundings the cliffs across the way also have ruins left in them. You cant get to them but you can see them and its crazy to image what it must have took to get to them. The going down those stairs is also easier than coming back up just remember you go down you must come back up. The rim trail is flat and paved and awesome if you just cant hike down into the canyon. This whole place is just beautiful and the day I went very quite and peaceful. There is a fee to visit this site but if you have a America the Beautiful pass ($80) worth it if visiting a lot of NPS areas Im not sure how much the fee was without that pass just that it does have a fee.",

        "text": "Simply amazing hike! If you are looking for a beautiful scenic hike with a challenge then this trail is for you. This hike is a 9 mile roundtrip day hike. Some sites list it as moderate, but It depends on your fitness level. If your like us and are one a month hikers, then this is difficult. It is not for the beginner hiker, you must be able to hike with appropriate gear and essentials for 4.5 miles in on rough, uneven, steep terrain. Ensure you arrive early for a place to park, the lot fills up quickly. And if you don't have a NW Forest Annual Pass, you can purchase one at the trailhead for $5 a day. If you are camping, you will need a special pass sold at local stores in town. You should really start early, especially in the warmer months for easier climbing at steep inclines. Plus you'll beat the crowd. This trail gets congested in the late mornings because most day hikers and campers are making their way to the pristine waters of Cholchec Lake. So for 2.2 miles from the trailhead to just past the footbridge, you will encounter foot traffic. But keep an eye out for the fork in the road and follow the signs to Stuart Lake to the right about a quarter of a mile past the bridge. It begins to get rocky and steep here so be prepared. If it has rained, it could be muddy as well ad as you cross over creeks and runoff. But once your on the Stuart Lake trail, you usually are alone encountering very few people. You will hike through thick forest, small patches of snow,open meadows, and great boulders, all along the Mountaineer Creek with rushing waterfalls. After another 2 miles Out of a thick area of tall evergreens Stuart Lake will surprise you on the left. Breathtaking and awe inspiring with snow capped mountain ranges all around. Find a high boulder for an unobstructed view. There are small paths leading to the waters edge all around the lake. Find one that suits you to sit, relax, picnic, and enjoy the view. If you've never been to Alaska or the Alps, then this hike is for you because this part of the Enchantments makes you think you are in some far off quiet place. The Alpine Lakes Forest Area just outside of Leavenworth is a great place to explore. Though we recommend a 4 wheel drive for the road to the trailhead, as it is not kept up and full of potholes and bumps. It is a dirt road that the runoff and snow melts usually goes down so it results in the washboard affect. Can get quite muddy when it rains, and is steep so don't bring your low rider. This trail is tough, but so worth the pain. Especially if you are the avid photographer looking for some gorgeous shots. Don't forget your camera.",

White Sands has been on my bucket list for many years and it was so incredible to get to witness the splendor and beauty of these rare dunes. The pure white wave-like gypsum sand dunes are so dreamy and magical. As far as the eye can see is desert and white sands. White Sands is the largest gypsum sand dune in the world measuring at an astounding 275 miles long. Also, the sand is cold to the touch and I mean really cold. I was wearing flip flops and a sundress and then went barefoot and the sand was like pure ice! Within minutes I couldn't feel my feet anymore and grabbed my boots to put on. White Sands is sprawled across The Chihuahuan Desert that borders Mexico and New Mexico. They have different routes and view points where you can spend time in The Chihuahuan Desert and White Sands gypsum sand dunes. The gorgeous pristine white sand dunes are so massive and impressive. Here you can climb or sled down the dunes whatever is your hearts content. At White Sands National Monument they also have a gift shop and a museum with knowledgeable park rangers. The admission is only five dollars which is a steal of a lifetime. You'll want to make your way from The Chihuahuan Desert to The Heart of White Sands where you can see nothing but white sands as far as the eyes can see.

The drive up was scenic and beautiful. We went the day after Christmas and it was pretty crowded at the gift shop. One reviewer mentioned watching the video there; there were so many people in the gift shop I never even saw where there was a video being shown! It was a 20 minute wait to purchase a sled (which I definitely recommend, because it's the most fun part of the experience of this park)! They offered new saucers for about $15 and if you're lucky and they're available, you can purchase a used one for $10. We were a party of 6, with three children and did just fine taking turns with one saucer. The park offers a buy back program, about $5 (on either new or used). The wax is about $2 new (you can also buy used, which I would recommend if available, because you won't use an entire block of it unless you plan to stay all day- about 8 hours) sledding the entire time. They also buy back used wax for 50 cents. The day we went, the weather was gorgeous; very few clouds in the sky. The sunlight is intense with the reflection from the white sand. If you burn easily, I'd recommend sunblock, even in winter. It was also quite windy and dry, so lip balm and plenty of water is a must. This time of year, it is advisable to dress in layers. On the sunny side of the dunes, it was quite nice and warm, however on the \"dark\" side, it'd be really cold and our feet were really cold on the cold sand. Our family walked the boardwalk and spent about 3 hours sledding down the dunes. Even though it was extremely crowded the day we went, there are so many dunes that we felt isolated enough in the spot we picked, which was nice. There are many variations to choose from as well, so you can choose a gradual, low slope for younger children, or a steep high slope for the more adventurous type. We did a little of both. It is quite exhausting on the legs, the traversing uphill repeatedly (we brought Arnica and were quite pleased with ourselves as our aches quickly dissipated)! The kids also slept really well that night! Also, I would say on sunny days, sunglasses are a must! Everyone in our group who didn't have them were wishing they did! After sledding, we hiked the Dune Life Nature Trail. There were many people sledding on the trail dunes and it's rather wide open; the noise making it difficult to see any actual wildlife. We did, however see some animal tracks in the sand. We also passed the time joking about the various human foot prints we saw. The views from the top are awe-inspiring. The trail is somewhat difficult to follow, however and we wound up not doing it completely because it took too much effort to try figure it out, when our bodies were already fatigued from sledding. We did enjoy reading the markers about the various animals, which was a nice touch (it should be noted we didn't have a hiking map, which could have been useful for hiking that trail). I read a review that said they have guided hikes at certain times, which I'd recommend. (We didn't know that was available.) There are covered picnic tables scattered throughout the sled/due areas. Also restrooms located throughout the park for convenience (they are drop toilets).",

There is both a gift shop and a National Park store in the Visitor's Center - you can get information about the park from the rangers at the National Park store. There are a few exhibits and a film about the park. If you want to try sledding (and we highly encourage trying it), you can purchase saucer sleds in the gift shop. Used sleds, when available, are $10 - unfortunately, there were not anymore available by the time we arrived. There are two varieties of new sleds, one for $15 and one for $17 - and there is a $5 buy back (if you make it back to the visitors center prior to closing, which we did not since we attended the enjoyable sunset walk). They usually also have sled wax for $2, but they were sold out of that on the day we were there. One hint for sledding - re-use an existing path where the sand is already packed down a bit instead of creating your own. You pay the $5 per person entrance fee at the gatehouse at the park entrance, which is after the Visitor's Center, and get the standard NPS map/brochure once you pay. The Visitor's Center is the only place that has running water - so fill up your bottles there before entering the park. Apply sunscreen and stay hydrated. There is no shade in this park. However, the gypsum sand is not hot and if you dig your toes down under the top layer, it actually feels cool due to the high water table and white color which does not absorb the sun's heat.

It was so worth it. With our head lamps, flashlight and camera we hiked along the alkaline trail. It was a calm morning. We watched the moon set behind the mountains and watched the sunrise. Our photos were amazing. We came across many animal tracks including a bobcat. We were all alone and it was so quiet. My husband & I also participated in the ranger led sunset stroll. It was pleasant and informative. We also captured some nice photographic moments on that tour. This monument is absolutely stunning!",

While you already know you are in the desert, to see these white sand dunes in the middle of the more \"brown\" desert is stunning. There is a very good video you can watch in the Visitor Center. Take the time to do that. It is worth it. Also, it isn't all that long. Buy a sledding saucer and a hunk of wax in the gift shop and then take a drive out into the dunes. There is a boardwalk you visit. It is only about a thousand yards long. It is elevated above the dunes. The dunes in this area are pretty small. Drive further back in to the dunes. They can get quite large. There are several spots where you can picnic and play in the dunes. We picked an area where there appeared to be people who visit the dunes often. We asked some questions about \"sledding\" and they gave us some good advice. It was a blast to get to ride the saucer we had purchased down the dunes. At the end of your visit you can return the saucer you purchased and get $5 back off your purchase price. So you don't have to worry about being stuck hauling a saucer back home with you.",

        "text": "Our family (two parents and kids aged 11, 9, 8 and 4) ADORED this place. We visited in late February and the weather was perfect, about 65F. And the sand was cool, even cold in some places! I figured we'd need our sneakers to get the most out of hiking and sledding, but our kids immediately stripped off their shoes and socks and ran out onto the dunes, and I'm so glad we adults did the same. Feeling that absolutely pristine sand on your feet is truly magical and was my favorite part of being there! (Unlike even the nicest beaches, which have shells, seaweed, etc., this sand has NOTHING in it. It's like walking on sugar.) Even in winter you definitely still need a hat with a brim, water, sunscreen (I burnt the back of my neck) and above all, sunglasses, both for glare and for wind-- we even brought goggles, which some of our kids preferred. You buy sleds at the visitor center/gift shop (all one building) for around $15, and they give you a $5 rebate for returning them, so consider it a rental. (They also sell used sleds for more like $10, but these are in high demand.) Buy the wax too. (It's dirt cheap and they still rebate you for returning it.) The dunes are enormous and some have pretty sheer drops, but you can sled down these steep slopes without fear because it's sand, not ice, so it's not slippery or fast (which is why you do need the wax)-- it was a pretty mild or even slow ride for adults sometimes, though kids went faster. Climbing back up is challenging, but there's always a slower-but-easier way up by taking the farther end of the dune with less of a grade. My kids had a blast, not only sledding, but playing, digging, burying their feet, writing silly messages, and acting out scenes from various movies. As for me, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed not only sledding, but also just the vast and otherworldly landscape, the mysteriousness of it (along with the history involving space shuttles and missile testing) and the experience of wandering barefoot through all this delightfully soft sand! Does sand get all over everything? Sure-- but it's a lot easier to clean off than beach sand because it's not wet. And putting those socks and shoes back on? Well, we rinsed our feet with a little leftover canteen water and all was well. (You dry instantly; it's a desert!)",

You will be wondering how can this place be different from adjacent areas. The place is so cool. The sand which look like and feel like refined sugar. What's amazing is that the sand is cool and never warmed up even if the temp is greater than 100. It's made of gypsum crystals that don't absorb sun heat. Love walking barefoot and see your footprints. Kids of all ages enjoying sand boarding or just rolling on the dunes. Minimal fee of $5 it's worth it. There's a lot picnic areas and restrooms around the 8 mile loop. You will also appreciate the flora and fauna in the area.",

The park is deceptively large and it's easy to underestimate how much there is to see. There is only one road that drives into the dunes and then loops back on itself, but on each side are wide swaths of dunes that stretch into the distance. There are parking areas all around where you can leave the car to enjoy the dunes. Each of the dunes is made of fine, soft gypsum sand that looks like something from Mars. You need only park your car and climb to the other side of the nearest dune to lose sight of civilization and feel like you're exploring uncharted wilderness! There are two formal hiking trails and one boardwalk. When we were there, the shorter hiking trail was closed so we walked the boardwalk instead and it took about 20 minutes to walk to the end and back. Then we drove to the end of the road and used our plastic sleds to sled down several of the closer dunes. The park was busy and there were families on each dune all around us. After a while, we started to hike the longer trail which winds into the Alkali Flats. However, it can take up to 3 hours to hike the entire marked trail loop so we made a casual circuit and headed back to the car. I'd suggest taking your sleds on that trail because some of the largest dunes in the park are off the road on the way to the Alkali Flats. BTW, the sleds can be purchased at the gift shop ($10-17 each, as I recall, and they will buy them back for $5) or you can bring any type of rigid plastic disc yourself. The park entrance fee was $5 per person.",

I bought 5 of them there for the same price as only one from the visitor center. These may be seasonal items so you might want to call the Walmart and ask first if they have them in stock. You can get wax at the visitor center to lube the sleds so they can slide down the dunes faster but I hear a simple wax candle could give the same effect.

Highly recommended you plan your visit to include a sunset! The visitor center gift shop is a little spendy. You can buy a new sled for $17 or a used sled for a lesser cost. I got mine for $10. It is what we call a \"flying saucer\" back home and is the exact same kind you'd use to slide down a snowbank (so if you're from a place that experiences winter, bring the one you have tucked away in your garage and save some money!). Also, don't expect a big adrenaline rush: I think my top speed was maybe 2.0 MPH. Other tips: bring water and pay attention to where you're going!

This attraction would be excellent for that person who just wants to relax and marvel at the wonder that is nature. There were kids sledding down the dunes, families cranking up their bbq and generally people just relaxing about the park enjoying this marvel. I came around sunset so being able to sit on a dune and watch the sun set and if you've been to New Mexico you know that their sunsets can't truly be described, now that was the icing on the cake.

Even my 4 y.o. timid little boy had a blast and got brave enough to go down the larger hills. You do get sand everywhere and since it was cold out, we had it in our coats and our shoes. Well worth the visit, even at 46 degrees we spent about 2 hours sledding down the sand. I wish we would have had more time to do some hiking after we were done sledding.

A few miles before you approach the actual entrance to the Monument Site, you will start seeing the sand dunes several yards from the thruway. Just the beginning of something \"amazing\". Once you arrive at the Visitor's Center, be sure to watch the 17 minuite movie which explains the HOW and the WHY of what you are going to see. Just can't say it enough....it is simply AMAZING. Once you have had a chance to spend some time in the center and the gift shop, you will get in you car and drive around to the back of the center and to the gate house for an amazing 8 mile ride though the White Sands dunes. (Don't forget to buy some water at the gift shop.....there is no drinkable water in the park. But there are port a potties available and also some nice picnic tables. Several miles in there is a raised walkway where you can walk over the sand and observe signage of the various plant like. It's a fun walk and the whole way with all that sand you could easily expect or at least wish the ocean was at the end. As you continue your drive the road will eventually loop back to the Visitor's center. You will see people at the top of the dune sledding down on the sand.

With the sun going down the dunes and the vetegtation looked so different in the evening light. It was AMAZING. So glad we took to time to see in at night.

Entrance into the attraction is $5 per person. There are large dunes that you can sled ride on, but we didn't get to do that this time around.

Stayed close to my car and people. Easy to get lost and turned around as the hills started to look alike. Recommend bring an ice chest with plenty of water and snacks. They have a picnic area and restrooms. BBQ grills. Price is good and not crowded. Get a bigger gift shop. Wear comfortable shoes as this is a workout. I wore flip flops due to the sand. Brought a fitted bed sheet and some old blankets for my car seats. Gift shop has a fountain to rinse your legs and feet afterwards. Nice family getaway with kids. Check with the local hotels for complimentary sleds or bring one. Overpriced in my opinion $16 and they really don't give you a lot back if you return it for cash back. Get the sled/disc at the gift shop before going into the park. I would recommend a rental option. Nice if I lived here but as a visitor and not living in a snow area I have no other use for this disc and it doesn't even say White Sands on it to be used as a souvenir. Good time. Recommend a compass, sun tan lotion, hat, baby powder to get the sand off, backpack, sunglasses, mirror in case you need to signal help. Two water bottles at min per person. ",

        "text": "So, this was one of those unexpected road trips where three middle-agers and one \"millennial\" found themselves trapped in the same car for eight hours, and while passing by White Sands National Monument someone happened to muse out loud, \"Why not?\" (as if being in the scorching hot desert sun in mid-August nearing lunch time is not reason enough!). With all of us in much need of levity, I was delighted to find plastic saucer sleds for sale in the nifty gift shop, $10 used and $15 new with the option to return on your way out of the park for a $3 or $5 refund, respectively. For an extra $1.99 you can purchase a square of wax which very much resembles a cube of pool chalk; the idea being that the sled will glide easier and faster if it is waxed on the bottom. This held some appeal due to a secret fear that my expanded backside would weigh down the saucer sled, resulting in an anti-climactic two-inch slide before coming to a complete stop. With our purchase of one used saucer sled, one cube of wax and four bottles of water we made our way to the entry gate and were pleased to find admission to be $3 per person and free for ages fifteen and under. I can't think of any \"attraction\" I've been to recently where one can gain entry so inexpensively! We snaked our way through the park, past several picnic tables and outdoor bathrooms, and finally found a perfectly secluded dune of moderate slope to try out our saucer sled. I found climbing the dune somewhat of a challenge as my calves fought against the resistance of sinking sand. Having visions of a Griswoldian experience, though, I eagerly waxed up my sled and insisted on \"ladies first\". To my expected disappointment, I slid about a foot before coming to a complete stop. It was real work scooching the saucer sled down to the bottom of the dune only to have to trudge back up and hand off to someone else. It was slightly reassuring that our youngest member and our thinnest member had about the same lack of success. The winner, in fact, was one of our middle-agers, a little round in the belly area, who tackled the saucer \"penquin-style\". He was able to slide down the dune with a fair amount of speed on his stomach and with a little bit of a running start. We spent about an hour exploring and attempting to slide before finding ourselves exhausted in the brutal heat and sun. There was a brief moment of panic when our key would not open the trunk, allowing access to our cooler and water, particularly when I noticed that we had no cell phone reception. I can see how someone might become suddenly overwhelmed with heat exhaustion, so please prepare, bring plenty of water and pay attention to your bodies! In all, we had a fun and memorable experience. It was certainly good for a few laughs. Next time, however, I might try to get ahold of some of that non-nutrative cereal varish to assist with the whole sledding endeavor.",

We choose the tallest we could find. We shared a sled so it was a good $7 spent. NOTE: Two different sleds for different weights. They also have trails to venture onto and a sunset walk and talk. We didn't do the walk/talk, but went back out to \"our dune\" and watched the sunset over the mountains. NOTE: This is vast in size.

Adding to the ambiance, it was 42 degrees while we were there and there was some snow mixed in the sand in spots. Light plays on the sand. it was cloudy while we were there so the dark sky made an interesting contrast. We walked some of the trails, climbed dunes, played in the sand, and enjoyed the views from this natural environment. We went out of our way to visit here in colder weather than we like and are glad we made the effort. It's worth the trip. Modest fee of $3 per. There are no hotels or campgrounds close by--st least 20-30 minutes away. We stayed in a little dumpy place in Alamogordo--it was acceptable for 2 nights, but no more.",

The dunes themselves are amazing, towering hills of white gypsum in endlessly different shapes and sizes. It\u2019s a terrific place for climbing, hiking, picnicking, sledding/sliding and generally just having fun playing in and on the sand. This place is also a photographer\u2019s dream -- the views of the San Andreas Mountains to the west and the Sacramento Mountains to the east are breathtaking. The vistas are simply huge beyond description, and the sunsets are spectacular. This is a magical place to visit at any time, but late afternoon is special due to the extraordinary light from the sun low on the west. Moonrise over the Sacramento\u2019s draws bid crowds and tours by professional photographers. Early evening is even more amazing here, especially if you can stay late enough for full sunset and are fortunate enough to have clear skies (which isn\u2019t that hard in southern New Mexico). This place is unlike anything you\u2019ll see anywhere else, which makes the White Sands a bucket list entry for me. The monument entrance is 15 miles west of Alamogordo, New Mexico on US Highway 70; entrance fee is $3 per person (kids under 15 get in free). The drive into the dunes themselves takes about 15 minutes from the entrance, depending on how far you choose to go. There are picnic tables and outhouses in several spots along the drive. Go to www.nps.gov/whsa for hours and more information.",

The only trail we did was the boardwalk trail, which was anyone accessible and the shortest hike. I'm sure some of the longer ones might have been better. We also didn't watch the movie or visit the museum, as we wanted to get out to the dunes before it got too hot. We'd been warned the sand could get very hot, but I guess we lucked out or got there early enough (we were there from about 9:30am-12pm), the sand was nice and cool and we were able to sled barefoot in August.

The sand is pure white and very fine and is spectacular against the blue sky. The gift shop at the visitor center rents or sells plastic sleds to slide down the huge dunes. We brought our own and it was all kinds of fun. Cost of admission is certainly reasonable but we were admitted free with our senior pass. There is a large area for picnicking and each table is protected from the sun by a curved roof which is artistic in and of itself.",

It's a little like snow after a massive blizzard without the cold and wet. There are several hiking trails available, all of which I found to be worthwhile, and you can even camp out overnight if you get a permit at the visitor's center.

Ruidoso is in the nearby mountains, has pine trees, and averages 20 degrees cooler temperatures. White Sands itself is unique and amazing. It is so beautiful, and I've never seen anything like it in the world. It has the largest white gypsum sand dunes in the world. The visitor center is a few miles southwest of Alamogordo. You won't miss it because there is nothing else there. The visitor center has a free 17 minute video that gives a good description of the dunes. It also has an outdoor garden of area desert plants with plaques and descriptions of those plants. I've always heard of creosote covered telephone poles, but never knew what creosote was. Creosote is one of the plants growing and described. The gift shop has plastic sleds available for kids to slide down the dunes. To get to the dunes, you must pay $3.00 per person, not per car. The older lady at the gate was extremely slow, but that is my only complaint. To get to the heart of the dunes you drive an 8 mile road. The first several miles are paved, then you drive on graded white gypsum sand. There was no problem with getting stuck in the sand. The first couple miles of sand dunes have quite a few plants growing on the dunes. The farther in you go, the fewer plants. Eventually you get to the truly white bare sand dunes. After you drive past the paved road you will see pullover areas to park your car. That's the place to get out of the car and climb some sand dunes. I'd say the average height is 30 feet or so, but some reach 60 feet, The contrast of the very white sand and the nearby blue mountains is so beautiful. Make sure to take photos. As I said, if it's summer and daylight, you won't want to stay a long time. It's hot. They do permit visitors until 10:00 PM though. Then spend the night in cool Ruidoso. If you want a longer side trip, check out Carlsbad caverns. Hope you enjoy it..",

When you first get there, you can visit the visitor center and watch the 17 minute movie on the history and science of the dunes. The visitor center offers a wide variety of interactive displays that teach you about the dunes and the wildlife that lives there. After that, you can purchase a pass to enter the park at $3.00 per person, unless the ranger isn't there, then you just drive in. White Sands offers many little hikes throughout the 7-8 mile driving loop. You can bring your lunch and your saucer for a day of fun! The saucers are used to slide down the sand dunes, similar to snow saucers. You don't even need to wear shoes! The sand is so soft. No matter how hot it gets, the sand does not get hot, but if you're there in the winter, the ranger said to wear 2 pairs of socks, because the sand gets so cold it could go through your shoes to your feet! Pretty amazing. During the summer, White Sands hold Full Moon Nights, three nights out of the summer. We attended this, and I highly recommend it. They have a band out there playing on the natural amphitheater the dunes create. The moon comes up and illuminates the dunes. At first, everything looks blue! It's so nice being our there at night. Definitely look into this if you plan on going in the summer. We also partook of the Sunset Stroll ranger guided walk. Our ranger was very informative and had samples of natural artifacts the dunes create and are created from. This stroll lasted about an hour and you don't walk very far. Check the visitor center or website for other ranger guided tours throughout the day. Have fun!",

        "text": "This desert national park is a true treasure. We bought sleds from a couple of people returning theirs. So you buy the sleds for 17 bucks I believe, although I think the used ones cost $10. You return them and receive $3 bucks back. We just bought ours from someone else for $5 and still saved $2. It's incredibly hot during the day to go walking or hiking or sledding - it can drain you. Consistent with desert climates, it does get chilly at night so dress in layers if you go. I recommend visiting either early morning and/or right before, during and after sunset. We particularly enjoyed the sunset views, walking deeper into the sand dunes to find better and bigger ones to sled down. Feel free to keep driving as far into the park as you can to find the untouched, cleaner dunes (less plants). The only comparable place that I've seen to White Sands are the Sossuvlei Dunes in Namibia, Southern Africa (but they are golden sands and not white). The white sand really does look like an Arctic landscape. Be sure to wear bright colors for an awesome photo-op. We took a picture of my friend jumping up in a red outfit and caught her midair- it came out phenomenal in the sea of white. You'll see some professional photo shoots also. I know they have sunset strolls, we missed arriving for that on time but I bet you learn a lot with the ranger. We just enjoyed strolling about on our own and trying to climb the dunes after sledding down. It's a workout! We also saw a cool beetle or two which was fun..it's an ethereal and unforgettable landscape. You feel like you're on another planet. Oh and they had the full moon bike ride that night too which we could not sign up for..if you're in town for that next time, you should definitely do it.",

Temperatures fluctuated 50 degrees between day and night. (Frost on tent in the morning; only the slightest of breeze just before dawn.) Cost about $9 total at gate for admission and camping permit. Checked in at visitor's center for assignment. Ranger very friendly and helpful. Nice small exhibits. Children wished bathrooms were more clean; they didn't like graffiti. Very little in way of sundries at gift shop. We brought one plastic disc for dunes. They sell them there but at a premium price. They also sell wax, which might have been a good purchase. Trailhead is about 8 miles from visitor's center, with large lot and vault toilet. As mentioned, the \"trail\" is from post to post. Easier on top of dunes; climbing can be soft and tough with weight on your back. We planned only for one overnight: brought lots of warm clothes, bags & blankets, food, stove, tent, lots of water, etc. Even for our short time in winter, I can imagine you could get burned easily. Children loved playing and a little exploring. This is Leave No Trace (pack in/pack out) camping. Actually got a phone signal from top of dunes near our camp site. Quickly warmed in morning; fun trek out; you can see road and lot from distance; saw other early morning hikers. Afterward we visited the Space Museum in Alamogordo, which we liked.",

And the park rangers were very helpful. Gift shop was typical -- some interesting stuff, though at high prices. Very modest collection of snacks, but sufficient, and lots of water at a reasonable price. Walking about in the sand was much fun, but the sledding is greatly overrated: The runs are very short, end on concrete-like desert floor, and that only matters if you can get the sled to travel at more than 1 mph. Rent is $17, but they will refund $5 if you return it. A bit of a ripoff in retrospect. Nonetheless the kids had fun and learned a bit about the desert and how White Sands came to exist. There are many bathrooms on the grounds. The main bathrooms were small and well worn, and they were not overly clean, but functional. There was supposed to a a $3 per person fee, but for some reason it was waived the day we were there. In all we spent about 4 hours on the site. Certainly stop here if in the area.",

Coming down out of the Mountains east of Alamogordo you can see the amazing stretch of white sands reaching out in all directions for miles. Comprising 275 square miles this amazing anomaly is interesting and a fun stop for persons of any age. The white sand is created from gypsum in the surrounding mountains as it is broken up by nature and then washed down into the valley by rains. Blown by the winds the pieces of gypsum are eventually ground by the wind and water into the finest sand-like particles and then formed into 60 foot high dunes again by the prevailing winds. A national park staff operate a small visitor center and are extremely helpful in educating visitors about the dunes and providing maps and guidance for venturing. A 15 minute narrated film show the high lights of the dunes, along with the plants and animals that make their home in the dunes. Day camping on the dunes is permitted as is \"sand boarding\" down from the tops of the dunes on plastic round snow discs. The sliding is exciting and fun for \"kids\" of all ages. The cost to enter the 16 mile round trip driving loop into the dunes is only $3 a person and you won't even have to leave the comfort of your vehicle to enjoy this incredible national treasure, unlike any other in the world!",

When it rains, all the water runs down to the dunes, therefore, the sand is moist and very cool. For hikers, there are trail markers, as it would be easy to get lost. The sand is incredibly white and the dunes reshape with the wind. There are some nice picnic areas if you bring a cooler. Next time we will be there when we can take advantage of the night programs. As awesome as it was in the daylight, I can only imagine how gorgeous it is in the moonlight. If you have a National Park Pass, it would take care of your admission.",

I believe its 300 square miles of pure white sand dunes in the valley of some mountains. Definitely go to the visitor center and watch the short video. Even our young kids enjoyed it. It is also worth buying the saucers (sleds) in the gift shop and don't forget to buy the wax there too. You will want to keep the saucer good and waxed to enjoy a fast ride down the dunes. An unwaxed saucer won't go anywhere. There are two options. You can buy new or used saucers to start and you can turn them back in after you use them for a small refund. I think a new one was about $14, and they give you $5 back if you return it. I didn't know there were used ones or I would have pick that option. Anyway, the bottom line is that this is a worth while destination where you can easily burn up several hours. You can pack a cooler with food and beverages (take lots of water) and enjoy the day. Keep in mind my visit was in September... I have know idea what the heat would be like in mid summer. Probably not as nice of a visit I would imagine.

As this is part of the National Park Service, you will find a wealth of information about this natural wonder. The fee for entrance is $3 per person and you have the option of walking on trails or driving the 8 mile loop around the park. We chose to drive as it was hot most days when we visited. As you enter the park itself, you will be astounded by the abundance of pure white gypsum sand that surrounds you like sand dunes on a beach. You will see nothing but white, almost like you were in a winter wonderland. Along the road you will find areas where you can pull off and walk into the dunes. There are boardwalks along the way as well and roof covered picnic tables for the family.

It is a $3.00/person entrance fee, which is good for 7 days and includes additional activities like the Sunset Stroll we took at 5 PM. When you first arrive, the visitor's center is across the breezeway from the bathrooms and they sell postcards, magnets, and offer literature about upcoming events at the park. There is also a knowledgeable ranger on staff who can answer questions about the park. There is a short film you can watch, which was not in operation when we were there. Behind the visitor's center is the gift store where you can buy more White Sands memorabilia and purchase a large disc sled for sledding down the dunes. To buy a sled is $14.95 and they will buy it back for $5.00. There is also sled wax for sale at the counter. It's 99 cents per block and is used to wax the bottom of the sled to keep the sand from sticking to it. We did not discover any of this until we were ready to leave the park so I'm sharing it with you now to keep you from making the same mistake. The Sunset Stroll, which starts 5 miles into the park from the visitor's center is also a must.

Apparently they will buy it back for $5 but unfortunately we didn't get to do that as the gift shop closed promptly at 7. So if you go for the sunset your (7:45pm sunset last night and the tour starts an hour before) and do a little sledding there is no time to visit the gift shop after which seems kind of silly to me. You would think the shop would stay open until the park closes...at 9pm. ",

They give you up to date directions to about six different awesome, isolated waterfalls, a church built in 1850 something and a natural bridge all in the forest. You can camp primitive anywhere with a permit from the ranger station and there's a $5 primitive campground close to double springs as well (we didn't see it though). Went to Caney Creek Falls (an easy 1.5 mile hike) and Kinlock Falls (right by windy dirt road) both gorgeous but someone needs to adopt-a-waterfall and clean up Kinlock falls, apparently locals trash it.

The various types of crystals we saw were lovely and the 'boxwork', which is the special feature of this cave, was enchanting. But the Park is so much more than the below-ground cave. We saw lots of bison (and sat and waited for lots of bison to get off the #@$# road so we could go on) and prairie dogs. There are a number of hiking trails. We did the self-guided Nature Trail near the main Park buildings and also hiked the Rankin Ridge trail.

There are a variety of tours to match folk's walking abilities, some use the elevator both directions while others have longer distances with stairs. Pick what suits your needs! We loved the tour and thought the Ranger really brought the history and the cave to life. You see interesting rock formations, get a feel for what it must have been like to be a first explorer in the Cave plus experience the total blackness of the cave with the lights are put out very briefly. One couple left the tour right at the start, not for them I guess. This slowed things down a bit as the Ranger had to lead them out. Another couple had a 16 month old in a front pack (only kind allowed) and the poor kid just wanted to get down and move around. I would suggest leaving younger children at the surface, the walking and stairs are not too difficult but I just don't think they would enjoy it. After the tour we drove around the park a bit and went on a 4.5 mile hike in the woods and grasslands. To our surprise a bison blocked the trail at one point, a bit scary as signs indicate that they can move at 35 mph. We did a very wide loop around him and continued on. ",

Kid is wheelchair bound, however the Ranger staff- Ina Winter- was very accommodating and we were able to go into 2 rooms via elevator. It's very different than Carlsbad, and Kartchner and Colossal in AZ, I guess due to the manner it was formed- there are no stalagtites/stalagmites, drapery, bacon, etc. Wind Cave is a \"tight\" cave- narrow passageways, low head space and without the large \"rooms\" of the other Caverns.

This is one of our (USA citizens) national parks and we should do whatever we can to make sure it's here forever. I won't go into each sight, but spectacular and outstanding goes a long way to describe this park and to see the animals roaming around is breathtaking. To stay in the park you need to make reservations a year in advance. We spent 4 nights and 5 days and saw a lot but you can stay much longer because you never run out of things to see and do.

        "text": "Our first stop was Zion. When you are in St. George you have NO idea what you are in for. Not until you start the drive No on 15 and cut east into the lower and main section of the park, do you realize the grandiosity of the landscape. You are surrounded by magnificent red rock that shoot vertically for 1000s of feet. At times its one huge slick rock and at others a collection of jagged edged rocks in attached at varying degrees. Below, is the virgin river cutting through the park surrounded by not a large variety of landscape plants and trees. Flowers are sparsely dotted along and every care must be taken not to disturb them by staying on the established paths. Every park we went to, I took photos of the different flowers, bushes and trees we saw. It's difficult to express the beauty of magnificence of what we saw - you have to see it yourself but here's the big takeaway if you are planning to visit. RENT A BIKE! You can rent a bile for 1/2 or full day, $25 or $35, respectively. Take the shuttle (bike loads on shuttle), all the way to the top to Shinawava Temple. Get off there and start your day! You will not longer be on the shuttle schedule b/c you can get on your bike and go at will. And what's even more wonderful, is that 90% is downhill. The uphill grades are manageable and even if you have to walk a few yard, big deal! You are in Zion! That's another advantage over the shuttle, you can ride at your own pace, stop and look at the scenery from the side of the road anywhere you feel like stopping! If you rely on the Shuttle, you can only get on and off at the shuttle stops and you only see what is at the stops. With a bike, you see the entire park at your pace. Park it anywhere and pick up a trail. I can't tell you have many stops we left where the shuttle line looked like it could be 100 deep. And def have a beer at stop 6 (?). It's wonderful! We actually packed our lunch in our backpack so turned off on our bikes near a spot along the river, sat on a huge tree trunk and ate listening to the river rushed by, instead of being surrounded by tourist trying to talk over each other. After lunch, we walked to a calmer spot and skipped some rocks before getting back on the bike and riding on. ",

Especially if you don't like the heat. It was already 70 at the end of March. Plan ahead, and book hotels/camp sites early. Bring your piggy bank, it's very expensive. Cheapest camp sites are $30/night. You can do the main canyon in a couple days, then head up to Kolob Canyon, and Kolob Terrace. Just as pretty, but a lot less people.

We are avid backpackers and were pretty anxious to have an opportunity to just get outside after a fairly rainy winter. We spent the first day driving the Zion Canyon Road and it was incredible, although visitors in the summer will need to take the park's shuttle. We had a campsite at the Watchman Campground booked online for the first night, and then we were able to get walk-up permits for a traverse that we'd been planning for a few weeks. We arranged a shuttle and dropped our car off at Lee Pass where we planned to end our traverse. We hiked from The Grotto up the West Rim Trail, where we camped at Site 9. The next day, we hiked down Wildcat Canyon Trail, picked up the Connector, and continued on the Hop Valley Trail. We camped at site 10 near Beatty Spring, which was fantastic. The third morning, we hiked to our car at Lee Pass on the La Verkin Creek Trail. Any of the sites we passed would have been great spots to stop for the night, so plan your campsite reservations based on the mileage you are comfortable with. We had perfect weather and plenty of sunshine, but there was still about 1.5 feet of snow on the Horse Pasture Plateau (a large portion of the West Rim Trail and Wildcat Canyon Trail were covered). We were prepared with microspikes although we only used them in one area. Check trail conditions when you arrive at the park.",

Shuttle service to the 12 different stops had already been stopped for this season - except the shuttles would be operating on November 24 thru November 26th. As a result, a number of the different nature's show piece's - could not be visited as there wasn't any place to park. Parking at the different stops are very limited. While signs are posted that parking on the road ways wasn't allowed - appears no one, including me, could read the warnings. Which made part of the overall experience less than great. However; after talking to the locals, the shuttle service may not be the answer either - locals claim that standing in line to catch a shuttle (they run every 15 minutes) was like standing in line to ride an amusement ride. Even with the limited parking - still worth the time we spent exploring just one of our nation's national parks! As for pricing - it really helps if you are over 62 - you can purchase a life time pass - good at all national parks for the bargain price of $10.00 - compared to the charge of $30.00 per car - good for 7 days - on foot or bicycle cost $15.00 each. PS - the pathways are very well kept and while step at times - most were an easy walk. We walked a total 7.7 miles or 16,153 steps in our 6 hour visit. That included looking for parking places.",

        "text": "My wife and i spent 3.5 days in Zion NP as the last of our 5-park hiking trip in Utah in October 2016. Zion has a greater number of challenging hikes (moderate + strenuous) in relation to its easy hikes, so this park offers more for the fit and hardy hiker than for the less fit one. That said, we enjoyed our time in the park. The only problem was the number of people who had less acquaintance with trail courtesy, most of whom came off tour buses that stopped at all the easy and even some of the moderate trailheads. Our advice is to avoid these folks by hiking such trails before 9:30am or after 5:00pm. After hiking over 100 miles in 5 parks, we decided it was time to find a coin laundry, since sink washing only goes so far. Our exploration of the forums for Zion/Springdale suggested there were coin laundries to be had, but where? We found Zion Canyon Laundry on the main drag. It is apparently connected to the next-door Bumbleberry Inn in some way. My wife and I used this coin laundry first thing on a Saturday morning to wash and dry our hiking clothes between days in Zion NP. Located at the Bumbleberry shuttle stop, this was only a 5-minute walk from where we were staying, so we bundled up our laundry and hiked on over. There were many commercial machines, both top-loaders and front-loaders, as well as two large commercial washers and dryers for things like sleeping bags. Only one washer was out of service while we were there and it was clearly marked. They had a change machine that handled $1, $5, $10 and $20 (!) bills. One could also buy detergent and bleach. Standard-size washers cost $1.75 per load and the dryers were $.25 for 10 minutes. The place has two sorting/folding tables and two rolling hampers to help with transport from machine to table. We met other fellow hikers doing their laundry while we were there, and there was a nice sense of camaraderie. As far as coin laundries go, this was better than most and well located. The only restriction is the total prohibition of eating, drinking, smoking --or cooking (!) while there. We weren\u2019t quite sure how someone would be preparing food while there, but realize backcountry folks will have gas kitchen gear and suspect the owners must have encountered cooking if they decided to ban it. Clearly, a big part of hiking is handling the dust. Being able to wash our clothes made subsequent hikes in Zion much more pleasant.",

At the Lodge, you can buy food outside and delicious ice cream soft serve cones, just inside the door. There is also a restaurant in the Lodge.

Plenty of both easy and strenuous hikes depending on what you can do. We did several easy trails that were not very long and enjoyed the views of the river, mountains, wildlife, and flowers along the way; it was very relaxing and enjoyable. Our room was a suite, but IMO was not worth the money we paid for it since it was not that clean and a couple of things didn't work in the room. The space in the suite was nice and would be more of a value if shared with another couple or 2. The bed was pretty comfortable and we really enjoyed watching the mule deer in the evenings from the rocking chairs on our balcony. Coffee in the room was good, fridge and microwave were pretty small, but good enough I suppose. Best part of our visit besides the encounters with wildlife was the open air tram tour that we took the evening of our arrival with our guide Jesse. Very informative, laid back tour where we got to see everything in about 60-75 min. We stopped a couple of times to take a few pictures and stretch our legs, but the great thing about the open air tram is that you can get a lot of fantastic pictures while riding in the tram! Love the tram, don't miss it! Well worth the $14 per adult (children are less). Glad we stayed in the park because of the mule deer and easy access to the lodge/shuttles, but to save money, you might consider staying just outside the park at say, the Majestic View Lodge or similar. There are several B&B's nearby also, but not sure of the prices. I highly recommend going to Zion!!",

It was a great stop to put in the middle of our trip to those two places. There is a $30 fee per car to enter based on how many cars you drove on your trip there or to your hotel. It is good for one week. You may drive through the part of the park that is open to through traffic with this paid receipt. This park was different for us in that you cannot drive through the section of the park that has all the trailheads. To get to those areas you must ride the park shuttle. All the shuttles are free. If you want to park at the Visitor\u2019s Center, you may if you can get there early enough to get a spot. Otherwise, the city of Springdale has a free shuttle also that takes people to Zion National Park Visitor\u2019s Center. It is very convenient as they run about every 5-15 minutes throughout the day and evening until about 9 p.m. We were only able to spend one full day in the park, but we were able to do a lot of trails. Emerald Pools was a beautiful trail which leads to three levels of waterfalls. The Grotto trail connects into it and we took it on the to the next shuttle stop in order not to backtrack. Weeping Rock is nice, but very steep although a short distance. A lot of people walk the Riverside Trail which leads to the Narrows. The day we were there a storm came up and prevented people from doing the Narrows trail. It is a trail IN the river. You may walk up to your waist or higher in the water. Those who take this trail are advised to start very early and have plenty of water and snacks as well as shoes suitable to walk in the water. There are several picnic areas and bathrooms scattered throughout the park. In Zion you are looking UP whereas at Grand Canyon you are looking DOWN. There are beautiful rock features and canyons here as you follow the trails up. We really enjoyed this park!",

We stayed in Kanab which was a little less crowded than Springdale but it did take longer to get to the visitor's center. It was 30 minutes to the gate and then another 30 to the visitor's center. It worked out ok for us because we took a day to drive an hour and 20 minutes to Page, Arizona to see Antelope Canyon and do a boat tour of Lake Powell. But if you are just doing Zion, I would say it is much more convenient to stay in Springdale. I think you end up paying a bit more for having such easy access to the park.

Springdale is completely oriented around Zion with outfitter shops, different types of restaurants from fast to higher bistro style. Be ready for this with small back pack, plenty of water, trail mix, first aid, etc. If you are hiking the slot canyons you will need water walkers on your feet & shorts or you can rent water shoes at a shop before you hike, some people wear wet suits. Pay close attention to the warning signs posted regarding possible flash floods. The day after we were there a few EXPERIENCED slot hikers were killed because of intense thunderstorms a few miles away. The other hiking trails provide fantastic vistas and you will not regret the experience. When you're done for the day and you are making your way back to the car there are more than enough restaurants to satisfy your appetite & your thirst. Highly Recommend & would love to go back.",

After the Riverwalk trail, I went back to the shuttle and took it to the entrance to the trail to the Upper Emerald Pools (an easy to moderate hike) and after lunch I did the Watchman trail which is somewhat underwhelming, but there is a river at the foot of the Watchman where you can swim.

The next stop was weeping rock a very short steep hike up to see the rocks ooze out water. The view is spectacular from the weeping rock. The lodge stop offers sit down or quick food and we opted fir sit down at 11:30. The taco Buffett was Good plus soup and salad before afternoon hikes. There are petroglyphs and we were lucky to find them and get photos. It\u2019s understandable the location is not noted on park maps so these beauties aren\u2019t destroyed.

Yesterday there was no admissions fees due to the fact that it was a national holiday where as today there was a fee of $20 to enter the park. We had arrived to the park around 4:30pm in the afternoon with a plan to see the lava flows in the Chain of Craters at night. When you drive down to the very end of the Chain of Craters there's a gated area with a turnaround and everyone parks along the shoulder on the right side so that way they may be able to walk towards the gravel roadway. While we were excited to see this natural phenomenon we did not anticipate the long walk that laid ahead. After parking the car there's roughly a 3 1/2 mile walk that's over paved and gravel roadways. At the end of the 3 1/2 mile walk you'll come to a barricade with usually a Ranger standing towards the end of the road. He will direct you to follow the rope that is staked down and runs the perimeter of the most recent lava flow. The neat thing is by the time we had arrive to that point the sun was almost setting so we Donde headlamps onto our heads which is highly recommended and make sure that you also have decent tennis shoes or boots to wear while traversing the lava flow. So while we're traveling and traversing this lava flow which took us approximately one hour to go along the perimeter of the roped off area you'll notice that the lava has a silver refinish it's very fine as well as everywhere you step it's like stepping on glass you're consistently hear the cracking of the rock or what is beneath you. Once you arrive on the other end of the lava flow they'll be another ranger directing traffic from all the visitors from the Pahoa side of the Big Island. Then you have the opportunity to block the last 100 m to the viewing area to see the lava flow flowing into the ocean. It is an incredible sight to see. Once you're done viewing the lava flow then you have a long walk back to your vehicle along the same route that you took. Recommend to all viewers that in regards to this specific lava flow I would charter a boat to see it by the ocean or come and visit through the Pahoa side of the park. ",

If you remember the 60's, this is a frozen moment in time. Even if you don't remember the time period, the history is riveting and the Pedernales River is green, flowing and so lovely.

Although one can reserve spots, you could take a chance to see if any available spots are available on the tour. This tour at this time costs $14.00 for adults. Starting at the natural entrance of the cave, the tour proceeds through a number of sections, most easily accessible for most individuals with decent mobility and is accessible for children; although, it is best for children capable of walking at least two miles. During the tour, one must be able to ascend or descend a number of steps, the most difficult being towards the end of the tour when a 150 step staircase must be ascended to bring you up to the main level of the cave. Two slightly challenging areas are the \u201cfat man\u2019s misery\u201d and the \u201ctall man\u2019s misery\u201d the first a section of the cave where the lower portion of the trail where your legs are is about 15 inches or so wide while the top portion is much wider. For most people it is required to go through sideways. Almost immediately after this section, one must essentially walk while lowering one\u2019s body several inches to walk through a short span that is not very tall.",

        "text": "A MUST SEE FOR EVERYONE. I had never been to a cave, and I'm told the tour I went on, \"The Historic Tour\", is the not the most amazing one, but I was most amazed. The tour was two hours and two miles. I'm overweight and lazy, and had no problem managing the hike. Every inch of the cave tour was fascinating. I strongly recommend a small LED flashlight to shine in the cracks and corners as you go. The park lighting is just enough to see your general surroundings, but I wanted more. The tour guides don't spent a lot of time talking, the cave speaks for itself. They stop at a few significant points, but mostly they let you walk and enjoy. I would say it's a bit much for any kid who can't get around on their own. It would be an awesome adventure and memory for any eight year old. You do NOT want to carry a child through this. If you are very obese, there are a few spots that might cause embarrassment. This is a tremendous value at $12.00, but coupons for 2$ off can be found in the area hotels. It's a national park, so every dollar goes to very good use. You could call it a day after one tour and be quite fulfilled. Book ahead because I'm told the peak season often sells out early.

It is one of those things you should see up close if you are in the area. I remember seeing it when I was a kid. I don't remember there being much more than a big parking lot with lots of trees in it and a visitor's center. It was a sculpture surrounded by nature. Now they have permanently scarred the area by building all this crap around it. There are restaurants (think $9 for a plain cafeteria burger), gift shops, an amphitheater. I think they are building all the stuff around it to compensate for the fact that all it is is a sculpture. If all you want is to see the faces, save yourself the $10 \"parking\" fee and look at it from outside. One thing I think is an improvement are the trails that let you walk all the way up to the base of the sculpture.

There were no lifeguards on duty so the bathrooms were locked. Previous reviewers recommended water shoes, which were critical for the slippery rocks.

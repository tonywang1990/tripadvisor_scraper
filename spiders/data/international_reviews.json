The beauty of the birthplace and family homes of John Adams and John Quincy Adams was apparent and the tour guides were well informed. It was definitely worth the time and small charge per person of $10 and I would highly recommend this to anyone visiting the Boston area.",

        "text": "While researching this before my visit, I noted that the NPS website advised arriving early at weekends as these were busy days so I arrived at the visitor centre, very close to the station (I travelled on the Red Line from Boston) a few minutes before they opened at 9am. I was greeted warmly and purchased a ticket ($10) for the 9.15am tour, on which I was the sole participant so, in the first two homes (the birthplaces of John Adams and John Quincy Adams) I had a private tour! But it was much busier later, when I returned to the visitor centre there were alot of people waiting for the trolley. The trolley takes visitors from the Visitor Centre to the first two homes and then to Peacefield, the home that John and Abigail Adams purchased on their return from Europe in 1788 and where John Adams died on 4th July 1826, the 50th anniversary of the date that the final wording of the Declaration of Independence was approved by the Continental Congress. Peacefield was subsequently the home of 3 further generations of the Adams family before passing to the National Park Service. In his will, John Quincy Adams requested that a fireproof structure, separate from the house, be constructed for the proper use of his books, papers and maps and so, in 1870, the medieval style Stone Library was constructed. A visit inside the Stone Library, which holds 12,500 books, was the last stop on the tour. After returning to the Visitor Centre I watched the 30 minute film which I had not had time to watch before visiting the homes.",

There are two superb displays in the lower halls but best of all is the short video of the battle. It really helps your understanding of what took place and helps to make your tour round the battlefield more meaningful. Thereafter if choosing the self guided tour, you just follow the map on the NP leaflet, going at your own pace. (You can get a guide to take you round if you prefer). There are eleven points of interest to stop at, including Dunker Church, as well as several walking trails. The landscape today is so beautiful and so peaceful. It is hard to imagine that so much bloodshed was spilt in these stunning cornfields and surrounding woods. The Sunken Road (Bloody Lane) is superbly preserved and displayed by the National Park as is the entire battlefield. On your stop at the Burnside (Lower) Bridge, cross over it and look back to see the old Sycamore Tree, which bore witness to the battle at this spot. Antietam was a significant battle for many reasons. More soldiers were killed in this twelve hour battle than on any other day in the war. The battle made the Emancipation Proclamation feasible. In addition, the battle reshaped the logistics of field medicine and also how battlefields would be memorialised in the future. A very interesting and poignant place to visit.",

It was a pretty steady stream of them, whirling out of the mouth of the cave, and swirling in a counter clockwise spin until they climbed out of the opening. It looked like smoke drifting off into the distance, with clumps going in different directions. We stayed until 1930 hrs, and the bat stream was still flowing strong into the evening dark.

He stood and posed turning his head in such a way to look regal, his profile against the backdrop of the sky and hoodoos. The boy noticed the crow and pointed it out to his mother and she told him to take a picture (the bird changed poses several times). When the family turned away, the big crow hopped down and followed them to their car where the mother said, oh give him some of your snack! The boy dropped a few nuts next to the car, and the crow had his payment. Moments later another car drove in to the same spot before he was finished and he had to hop out of the way. The people exited with their cameras, and the crow hopped right back up onto the post and struck a pose again! The vistas are stunning; that crow was unforgettable!

I was surprised at the $30 price tag to enter so we just bought an $80 year round Utah National Park Pass. As always the rangers are highly knowledgeable and offer tours. Viewing all the points are easy because they are on the east side, so if you start from one end of the park, you will make right hand turns the entire trip. Stay for sunrise and sunset. The views are spectacular. If you are afraid of heights be careful. Going down near Thors Hammer is steep and going back up is tiring. This is one of the higher elevation parks.

        "text": "If you like the desert, open spaces, gaping chasms and wild rock formations, you will love Bryce Canyon. Do you remember how you felt when you first walked up to the Grand Canyon? Bryce is the same. Absolutely unique rock formations that hang in the air. It beggars belief how some of the monoliths here have not snapped off in the often blustery conditions. The Queen's Garden and Navajo Loop are the best known walks, and a must, but we also did the Rim Walk/Fairyland Loop/Tower Bridge circuit (approx 13kms) early in the morning when no one was around. Bit of a hike, but absolutely stunning. For those who can't get around too easily, as is the case with the Grand Canyon, the Rim walk is quite long and most of the sections can be traversed easily with few rises/falls. It would also suit wheelchair access, and the shops/visitor centre and showers are all wheelchair friendly. We spent two days in the campgrounds which are predominantly first come, first served. So get in early to get a spot. The North Campground is great because it's close to the walks and shops. Even in the off season there are plenty of visitors, and all the spots fill up pretty quickly. You have to buy your firewood, you can't pick up any wood from the ground. There are fresh water taps everywhere and a smattering of toilets, but no showers. If you want a shower, you have to go to the General Store and its $2 for 8 minutes. About half a dozen showers and the water is nice and hot. Definitely try and get to the sunrise and sunset points, or one of the viewing points along the rim to see the light show. Oh and if you are doing a National Park crawl, make sure you get the Annual Pass for $80, it's approx $30 for entry at most National Parks, so it pays off pretty quickly.",

That being said, it was most definitely an experience not to be missed! Although it was a sunny, mid-July day, the temperature was not unbearable at all. It was quite pleasant, in fact. As (unlike Zion, which we visited later on) you were able to bring your own vehice in the Park, after we passed through the gates (we had purchased the $80 Annual pass, as we were seeing a number of parks on our trip and that was the most economical option) we drove to, and parked at, Bryce Point. There was no problem finding a parking spot at about 10:45 am on a Tuesday in July. The first view of the Bryce hoodoos is absolutely breathtaking! I actually found it more beautiful (and most definitely more unique) than the Grand Canyon, which we had seen earlier in our trip. Just so unexpected, so not-of-this-world, so amazing! We took our time soaking up the view from Bryce Point, and then drove (and again, parked, without a problem) to Inspiration Point, where we spent some time walking to-and-from Inspiration Point and Upper Inspiration point; again, just soaking in the sites, taking zillions of photos, marveling at the natural beauty in front of us. Due to time constraints, our last stop was to drive to Sunset Point. Here there was a large visitor structure, where I assume restrooms and the like are located. It was much busier here than at the previous 2 lookouts we visited, but perhaps that is because it was now close to lunch time and the park was perhaps getting busier. We walked a bit of the Navajo Trail from here, though not for long as we did, unfortunately, need to leave. We will remember our time in the many photos we took, and already those we shared them with are planning their own trips there!",

Reminded me of the Alberta Badlands. We trekked all along the rim of the Canyon, covering Sunrise Point, Sunset Point, Inspiration Point, Bryce Point, etc. The walk was absolutely invigorating, with the clear skies, sun shining down and a breeze blowing...but the elevation was certainly something that made us short of breath at times, especially going all the way up to Inspiration point. I think the highest elevation was 8300 feet at Bryce Point. We did not trek down into the actual Canyon to be up close to the rock formations, but you could see lots of people with hiking gear and staffs down below on the trails doing just that. Plenty of parking at all the points when driving around (as it was the off season and there was no shuttle) and each point had information stations where you could read about the history of the area/geology, etc. Also a great opportunity to see native bird species; I saw a Clark's Nutcracker, Common Ravens, etc. make a point to go to Bryce Canyon for sure as you will not be disappointed.

We are experienced walkers so it took just over 2 hours round trip. This walk takes you right down into the canyon and so one must remember if you go down you have to walk back up. It might be tough going for young kids or the elderly or people with any heart convictions. Otherwise a must as this canyon is fantastic and you see lots of wildlife on the way. We then had a picnic at Sunset Point. There is a small general store to purchase snacks pizza or soup should you desire. We then drove to all the other viewing points starting with Rainbow & Yovimpa Points . Each one special with something amazing. My personal favorite viewing point was The Natural Bridge.

The entrance fee is $25 for 7 days. You can drive all the way to the end point - 18 miles ... with scenic points along the way to look down into the 'canyon'. THEN you can see what everyone's talking about. Each viewpoint is different and the colours and shapes are awesome. Note: the parking lots at each viewpoint can accommodate both cars and RV's but they can fill up quickly as some of them are the starting points for hikes. The park has an excellent shuttle bus service that picks up and drops off at many different points along the way and is an great alternative to driving and it's free! Camping in the park is limited and fills up VERY quickly in the summer - we were there in May and one campground was full although the other one was only about 1/2 full. Prices are $15 for an RV with 2 people per night. If you're looking at them on-line it's confusing as the on-line maps show 'North' Campground and 'South' Campground but when you get there it's North and SUNRISE campground. Not South. The North one is the first you come to and of course that fills up first - also it has a shower and general store inside the campground. The Sunrise is actually a little nicer tho I think. Both campgrounds have NO hookups at all so be warned. There are private campgrounds near with full hookups although they're pricey. There is a lodge also which looks pretty cool. It was built in the 1920's and just looks like it's out of a movie! I don't know the prices for the lodge. (There's also a very cool gift shop inside!)",

On my first day I had one chance to go down the road to the Grand View Point was the farthest point that section. And the next day I take the time to go to the Green River Overlook and the Mesa Arch. Consider 30 minutes or less of your time to visit the Visitor Center. Carry water with you although the attractions of this park are near the road and do not need to walk much. If you see a sign that says Shafer Canyon Overlook park your car and contemplate a spectacular view. The best photo opportunities are Mesa Arch at sunrise, Green River Overlook or Grand View Point at sunset.I use the Annual Pass.",

As we turned off highway 89 and started along highway 14, we noticed some snow high up in the mountains. As we climbed higher the roadside was caked in snow and soon it was everywhere. We turned onto highway 143, a rim drive that runs along the monument with several scenic view points along the way, and every thing was covered in snow. We had to walk in snow at least 6 inches thick to get to the viewing platforms, but we were loving it as we don't see much snow in Australia where we live . Even though this is small compared to Bryce Canyon (no Hoodoo formations ) it is certainly a must do on any travellers list. It is so amazing and the dumping of snow just took it to another level for us. There is no walking into the canyon, only the view points, but that's okay, as it is still awesome. There is a small fee for entry, but if you hold the America the Beautiful Pass it is covered. It is a good idea to purchase one of these passes if you are doing a few national parks as it does save you some money. They can be purchased online, or at any park you visit.

The geology of the area is very interesting. The rangers at the peak gave a very informative talk about how it all came to be. There were restrooms, a small gift shop and picnic facilities there.

Whew, ensure you heed the advise of plenty of H2o and food. There aint sh*# to purchase to remain alive here. Not one item of food or one bottle of water can be purchased. A wierd feeling knowing what you have is what you have and you cannot replenish until you leave. I planned to stay one night, ended up 2 nights. Ran out of planned food, and had to start on the reserve (tuna), yech. Feel like a cat. Camping was full both nights, Almost had to go park at top of canyon to catch a few winks. Trying to go up to Pueblo Alto I froze up and couldent go any further about half way up rock wall just before the crack. Had to backtrack down to tierra firma. Went up to Tsin Kletzo on opposit side of canyon. All the small caves and hiding possibilities is incredible, many thousands of people could hide in the Chaco area no problem. The road in is fine if you drive it correctly. Drive between 30 and 40 throughout the dirt road. \"Feel\" for the best part of road with your vehicle. You will feel a clear difference when you are at the right speed. You will feel if you are going too slow, and if you go too fast, you will surely slide off into an arroyo. Slow down for any curves or dips. Careful if you near Chaco in the dark, elk are frequently on main road close to the park. The road in to Chaco from 550 is not an issue. Yes its a long dirt road and the vehicle is shaking but hey, within a short while you will drop into the canyon and see Fajada butte. At that point you will realize you are going to be experiencing something special. the guided programs were ok. Can tell they do it often as it sounds almost recorded but you are staring at a person.

The visitor center staff are most helpful, but they were forced to show us a 3 ring binder of the disputed area as access to that present day location is off limits. It was like visiting the Maytag repair man. Before we left they made each of us fill out the survey for the site because they had so few completed for the year. We even stayed to see the short video. Once you spend 10 -15 minutes at the visitor center, there is absolutely nothing else to do. Part of the center is devoted to cultural displays. We even perused the paintings. You can see the border crossing from the park as well. We continue to have issues with some of our memorial sites, and this site certainly falls into the \"how did they pull off that\" category.

There is a $15 park entrance fee per car and it takes over 2 hours to reach the rim from Roseburg, but it is so worth it. There are several vantage points to stop and look at the lake with a cafe/gift shop in the Rim Village. There is also a lodge to eat at and stay the night but it is expensive. We brought our lunches with us and bought drinks and ice cream at the cafe (that was expensive enough). You could easily spend all day here, so leave early because there is also road work going on near the top right now. We were so happy that it was good weather the day we went up. We heard that the next day, there was a small forest fire, so that would have been troublesome to say the least.",

Bear in mind the weather too, in July it was great weather, sunny and around 70 degrees but they get snow and roads get shut so may be worth checking before hand.

        "text": "Formed in the centuries following a huge eruption of Mount Mazama 7700 years ago, and the ensuing collapse of the top of the volcano and formation of the present day caldera. Crater lake national park is easy to get to, but it is a relatively long trip. I-5 to exit 30 and turn NE at the end of the ramp - you'll be on Oregon Highway 62. It is 45 miles from Medford to the town of Prospect, on the SW edge of the National Park (1 hour driving time). From Prospect, it is a further 28 miles to Munson Valley Road, turn left onto it and you will immediately be in Mazama Village. Stop here at the Visitor Center, pay your entry fee ($15 per car) - but before you do, you might want to stop at the Annie Creek Restaurant (finest in the park for the money - see my separate review). From Mazama Village it is only 7 miles on Munson Valley Road and the Rim Drive to Rim Village. Follow the signs up the mountainside to the Steel Visitor Center (9 am to 5 pm), and then on to Rim Village Visitor Center (9:30 am to 5 pm). The Lodge restaurant is open from 7 am to 9 pm). Now, I have a wife and 2 daughters who are 'full service hotel' people. When they saw the bathroom, TV and wifi limitations at the lodge, they immediately decided to stay in Medford! Besides, reservations are normally back logged a year in advance. At the Visitor Centers, there are interesting videos about Mount Mazama and how Crater Lake formed. The gift shops are small, but certainly adequate for a souvenir or 2. If you haven't eaten at Annie Creek, there is dining at the Lodge open for non residents (reservations highly recommended) and a small Cafeteria style Cafe at Rim Village. Most people take a ride / drive around the rim, a distance of 33 miles. A bit of advice. Go in the direction where you will be in an outside lane, away from the edge of the precipice! But even then, the driver will not be able to see many of the views. Too many curves, narrow shoulders, pedestrians and bicyclists to drive on your own! And then there is the opposing traffic. Take the trolley instead, $27 per person. Leaves in front of Rim Village Community House. Bring the credit card you reserve online with, because your card will not be charged until the day of your tour! Tram tours last 2 hours, stops at several stunning overlooks, and removes all stresses from the circuit. Even if you go in July, expect a bit of snow here and there olong the rim, the altitude up here is about 7000 feet. Multiple stunning colours and views of this 'deepest lake in the U.S.' At around 1943 feet. Plan on spending a day here, because between the commute, a meal or two, and the Visitor Centers, you will need that amount of time. And one more crucial point. Before leaving Medford, make absolutely sure you have a full tank of gas! Enjoy!",

We went to Crater Lake on a Monday so it wasn\u2019t too crowed. I have been to several national parks and would have to say this was the most accessible park yet. They charge a $10 entrance fee per car. The view points are not far from each other and very easy to get to. The parking was easy also. I would not recommend traveling with an RV since there isn\u2019t really any RV parking at the view points. They do have a trolley you can take if you don\u2019t want to drive. If you are travelling during the summer all the roads Should be open and you can drive all the way around the crater which I would definitely recommend. If you get nervous with driving near cliffs be aware for a good portion of the drive around the lake there are cliffs right at the edge of the pavement. I was very nervous but made it through. We drove very slowly on those parts. One day is plenty of time to spend at the crater if you don\u2019t plan to take long hikes. The mosquitoes were pretty bad so bring plenty of spray and wear long sleeves and pants. We ended up eating our picnic lunch in the car because of the bugs. We decided to take a boat tour. Since we didn\u2019t book tickets in advance we were able to go to a kiosk at the lodge to purchase tickets. We weren\u2019t sure if we could get tickets, but they did still have some for the same day on a late afternoon tour. The hike to the boat launch is 2.2 miles round trip with a 700 ft. elevation and is marked strenuous. This is very similar to the hike for Multnomah Falls in the Columbia Gorge, OR. You need to take into consideration the elevation and the weather for this hike at Crater Lake. I get pretty nervous with heights. Three out of four of us slipped on the way down. The trail is dirt and small rocks which makes it very slippery and dusty. We held the hands of our kids the whole way. It took us about 25 minutes to get down and about 45 to get back up. The tour cost $108 for the four of us. It was two hours long and drove very slowly around the perimeter of the lake. They have a park ranger who tells the different theories of how the lake formed on board of the tour. Most of these facts you will read at the view points and you can see nearly everything from the view points. It was a very slow tour. The kids and I were bored and ready to go after about an hour of it. You must bring plenty of water and food for this tour. The bathrooms were disgusting (out houses). I would bring some TP with you just in case. I could have lived without this tour. I would not recommend this excursion to families with children 10 or younger. Driving around the crater and stopping at the view points was good enough for me. The lake is beautiful and I was able to get some gorgeous pictures.",

It was clean and very basic with no tv, radio, coffee, candy, water, magazines, or anything to suggest hospitality or comfort. Like a large outhouse with a bed in it.

Unfortunately the smoke detector outside the room beeped and alarmed every 5 minutes all night, and i was unarmed. I decided to walk to the beautiful log cabin village restaurant for breakfast as a treat to start my day. I ordered a poached egg and it came on a white plate, all alone, cold and slimey and raw. After I gagged that down I ordered a nice warm \"home made\" cinnamon bun from the huge open gourmet kitchen that i could see and hear was staffed by a whole line of blue ribbon chefs. Over the banter of the line chefs and orders I heard the beeping of a microwave oven, but tried to remain optimistic. Eventually a plate arrived bearing a microwaved \"heat and eat\" premade bun that was dry outside, cold an dgoopy inside, and coated with weepy white icing from a tube. I was saddened, but even more so when I got my bill and saw the bun alone was $7. Tv chef ramsay would have asked them to turn in their aprons.",

I rented a bike in Peninsula, hopped on the train (only $3 for cyclists!), got off, and enjoyed solitude on the trails. I stopped for an Italian ice at Trail Mix, and continued back to Peninsula. I saw wildlife like chipmunks, turtles, and heron. The train is scenic, though I can only speak for a portion of the route that I was on. Sit on the river side of the train! Don't expect it to be high speed; I think it moves around 30 MPH. After that, I went to Brandywine Falls. Parking is available close to the falls. The walk is less than 0.5 miles, with the option of stairs or a ramp. I went on a weekday during the afternoon and I highly recommend it if you want to avoid the crowds.

The driver had a rough, monotonic (like in a robotic recording) voice. The bus stopped for viewing of animals only when some sharp-eyed passenger shouted out to announce their presence. Even then, the animals were so far away that, if you didn't have binoculars, you'd be lucky to espy them in the few minutes that the bus remained stationary. You see images so tiny that you have to leave it to your imagination to conjure up the images of the animals they were purported to be - not my idea of viewing animals in the wild. The $7 extra we paid to visit the Wildlife Center on the Narrated Wildlife Tour offered by the Whittier to Anchorage Cruise Transportation service provided a much better opportunity to see many of Alaska's wildlife at close range even if they were in enclosures. Although, there was one overlook point (to view Mt. McKinley), the driver never pulled into it. When I questioned him about it, his respone was that the peak wasn't visible, the skies being cloudy that day. There was nothing to be seen at Toklat River terminus either. We were glad that we didn't spend the extra $10 to go up to the Eielson Visitor Center. We'd have wasted another 1 hour only to see nothing more than some pictures at the Visitor Center. On our return trip to Anchorage the next day, we had a fantastic view of Mt. McKinley from the front yard of a restaurant/motel just south of the South View Point (I believe its name is Mary's Cafe or something like that - which also served some decent coffee) about half way to Anchorage - you cannot miss it if you're driving; it's the only restaurant on the west side of the highway standing all by its lonesome self out in the vastness of Alaska's wilderness.

You are not allowed to enter the park with your own car. You can walk , but that would be impossible. You are required to use Aramark industries as a private consultant, and they will drive you in on a packed old school bus for $45-$120 per person per day. But, you must also pay the park entrance fee on top of this to the park service of $10 per person. A complete scam. No other park, specifically Yellowstone, the grand park, does such a terrible thing. You pay $25 at Yellowstone for a 3 day unlimited pass for one car to the entire park, as a taxpayer should. On top of all of this, the wildlife is very limited and is certainly not compared to Yellowstone. The people are scammer types that charge $30 for a baseball cap and $15 for a hot dog type, if you know what I mean. What a huge disappointment.",

BUT given the huge amount of money spent to restore the building it's a real shame the standard of presentation is so weak. When we last came ten years there was a coloured panel that helped you pick out the jumbled bones of each animal by using a different colour for each one. Now there's very little to help you understand what's going on - just a couple of well-intentioned rangers, a few basic information panels, a $1 kids' booklet, and very little else. The truth is that you are looking at a large grey cliff face scattered with a large number of disarticulated grey bones, some of which are quite a long way above you and it's very hard to make sense of, especially for kids who are probably expecting something far more dramatic. None of the skeletons is complete which means you are looking at a stack of vertebrae here, a bit of tail there, a couple of leg bones over there and so on. This is a place that is screaming out for a presentation video, better labelling of the bones and so on. Ironically, the wall displays of skeleton plaster casts are considerably more informative and easier to understand. We came a long way to see this and we were in and out of the cover building in about 30 minutes and that was stretching it. In some respects the 1.5-mile trail back to the parking lot (you have to come up to the quarry by shuttle) which takes you past an open-air section of the quarry with bones in place was more evocative. So, it's undeniably worth visiting and very memorable but I had the feeling it could with some time, trouble, and money, be a lot better.",

There was a video on the history of the fort, the land, and the waters around it. Swimming is permitted to swimmers at the north and south beaches. For those who wish to get in the water, there are warm fresh water hoses on the stern of the boat to rinse the salt water off your body, and a hose on the dock to wash the sand off your feet, and change rooms on the dock. There are guided tours of the fort, or you can tour at your own leisure, the fort is in the process of being restored, so there are areas that the public has no access to, but don't worry, there is plenty of area to explore, including walking the mote wall around the outside of the fort. There are three levels of the walls to walk, observe the restored 25 ton canons, enjoy the view from the top level, stair wells are in the corners of the fort. Over night camping is also permitted, so bring a tent, if that's your fancy. There is a small gift store to purchase souvenirs on the property. On the return trip, all names of passengers are accounted for before the ferry leaves, and the bar is open for those passengers who are over 21 years of age, and have the cash to purchase beer, wine, and mixed drinks.

We came in from the Ebey Prairie trail (which takes you to Jacob ebeys house), and decided to take the trail down to the bluff. So glad we did! We noticed a sign for a loop hike along the ridge down to the beach and then back up. The loop is about 3.5miles( 5.5km) i am guessing here but add about another 1mile (1.5km) to get back to the car. We never rush so the whole trip took us about 3 hours. It is an easy hike expect for the climb in the beginning to get up to the ridge. The trail travels beside some pretty steep drop offs and I am not a fan off heights so my knees were shacking a few times. Not sure if I would take young children up there. One wrong step could end up in disaster. But the views are absolutely stunning so even being afraid of heights it was absolutely worth it, You will be walking along a narrow sandy path but the loop part along the beach is quite rocky so I would still suggest hikers or sturdy shoes. Bring your camera, pack yourself a lunch and enjoy the breathtaking views! This is a State Park so a usage fee is required. 10 $US or an annual Discover Pass for30$US",

I love the park; its truly beautiful and I always see plenty of alligators and birds; some alligators so close you could almost touch them! BUT DON'T! On 4 occasions I have rented the park bikes, most recently over the Thanksgiving weekend and every time they are just horrible! While its the best way to enjoy the park if you enjoy biking the 15 miles round trip; the bikes are in such poor shape, it can be unpleasant! Knowing this, I always get an early start and arrive in the park no later than one hour after opening, so I can test drive a few bikes. The bikes are OLD, in poor repair, although they have a staff always working on them. The day we were there (November 25th) there seemed to be more bikes awaiting repairs than there were for rent! They don't have hand breaks, only pedal breaks,very uncomfortable seats and some are very difficult to pedal or make noise all the time while pedaling. TRY ridding several! To make matters worse, they are EXPENSIVE to rent at $9 hour on top of the $25 entrance fee to the park! If you have your own bike, you can use it in the park; highly recommended!",

On the first day we followed the tradition route from Homestead to the Ernest Coe Visitor Center and eventually reached Flamingo Visitor Center, which was closed. We went on a ranger led walk through the Anhinga Trail but saw no wildlife and we had pouring rain at the end. I guess the park is quite wet at the end of the rainy season and alligators could hide anywhere, on top of that they just finished renovating the trail and it will take a little longer for the wildlife to come back. The next day we woke up early trying to catch the sunrise at Pa-hay-okee Overlook but again the weather was not very cooperative and we ended up finding some birds around the West Lake area. The third morning we woke up early again and the weather was reasonable, we drove west on the Tamiami Trail and reached the Shark Valley Visitor Center before 9, we found out there is a tram running at 9:30, the ride is around 2 hours for $24. What an amazing ride, because it was in the morning, bird and wildlife were amazingly active and we had many BIF and alligator shots, it is indeed a wildlife photographer's dream. We will definitely go back to explore further, but will take a little more time to plan ahead. This quick stopover was the beginning of our trip to Machu Picchu and Galapagos Islands.",

Site of the writing of the poem 'Star Spangled Banner', set almost immediately to the tune of 'To Anacreon in Heaven' - a popular English drinking song. Francis Scott Key wrote it from the deck of HMS Tonnant as a prisoner. He had gone aboard the British vessel to negotiate a prisoner release/exchange, but while aboard became too familiar with the strength of the British fleet and their intention to attack Baltimore. Therefore he himself was seized and held prisoner! Most of the remains of the fort are intact. What was most interesting to me was that the Fort's principal defences were manned in 1814 against the attacking British ships by U.S. Navy guns and gunners! Not U.S. Army guns and gunners! Well done Navy!!! See the 10 minute video first, sign up for the 'War in the Chesapeake' Talk (one of the best NPS talks in the nation). Excellent Gift Shop. Take a drink with you, it gets warm.

After watching the film in the Visitor's Center - be sure and watch this before you walk out to the fort - we walked to the fort and spent an hour walking around it, reading the information and visiting the buildings inside the fort. It is beautifully restored. This should be the #1 place to visit in Baltimore! The next day we visited the Flag House where Mary Pickersgill made the famous flag - again, an important place to visit for anyone intererested in the War of 1812 battle that took place at Baltimore.",

There were several re-enactors (military & civilian) a fife & drum corp & cannon firing. Volunteers & rangers to answer any question you might have or to lead tours.

That feeling alone, is worth the money. As one of the wonders of the world, I feel like you have to take the helicopter ride to truly appreciate the size and beauty of the canyon. There's great views of the Colorado river, and our pilot chatted throughout, pointing out interesting elements of the canyon. Of course the ride doesn't last long enough, but it's unforgettable.

You have to see them to comprehend the scale. We hiked High Dune which is 700 ft high. Set off at 9am and can tell you it was hard yards in a few places. Stick to the ridges and you'll do fine. Don't climb the face of a dune - we did a short one and that was a bad move! Views from the top spectacular and worth the effort. If we had more time would have gone to Star Dune. Climb Dune Overlook as well if you have the time. It's not a long or difficult hike but provides a super view over the dune fields. We also went to Zapata Falls - you can see dune fields from there too but it's a bit far away to be any good. Oh, and if you want to take photos of the dunes, go early as the shadows are most dramatic at first light (at least in July they are). If you go at sunset, the sun is behind the dunes so you you're facing all shadow so much less dramatic.",

If you are hiking, be prepared, sunscreen, first aid kit and clothing appropriate for climate. Permits are required for overnight trips in to the wilderness area and are FREE. Available from the Headquarters Visitor Centre until 3pm. Well signposted from the main road. The road is 38 miles of winding 2 lane well paved surface. Be mindful of posted speed as there are many, many hairpin bends. This is a popular route to bike, up and down, so watch out for bikers at all times. Once you enter the park there are no guard rails so be very careful. There is a $20 entrance fee to the park which must be paid via credit card only. The ticket is good for 48 hours. The first visitor centre, the Headquarters Visitor Centre is just inside the park. Stop here for good information, a map of the park and bathrooms. From here it takes approx. 30 mins to reach the second visitor centre, the Haleakala Visitor Centre, open from sunrise until 12 noon. Many people like to go here to watch the sunrise. Again, lots of information about the park from knowledgeable park rangers. You can take many different hikes or just enjoy the ambiance of your surroundings. From here you can take a short drive to the summit, over 10,000ft. The observatory is off limits to the public but is the fourth best place on the planet to view the universe. On the drive from the base, don't be put off by the change in weather. You may encounter sun, rain, overcast, low cloud all within 20 mins or so, but keep going - it's worth it! If you are a nervous driver or don't like heights it may be an idea to take a tour rather than drive yourself, especially in the dark (going up to experience the sunrise).",

Take note the ticket booth doesn't give change for your park pass so have the $10 per car. Once at the top we stopped at the crater lookout.....that is a sight in itself looking over into that vast area with all the changes in colors.. Wow. We arrived at the summit lookout about 45 min from sunset.. Took a look around at the observation area with all the great information, It was cold and windy but we were prepared and dressed for the occasion, Our biggest laugh of the day was seeing everyone wrapped in the striped hotel towels and even one lady in a bedspread. Not everyone reads trip advisor before taking this trip I guess :). As the sun went down I realized that the observatory that is at the summit (not open to public) sits directly in front of where the sunset would take place so after a few photos and some deliberation we decided our best view would be a little down the mountain at one of the lookouts so that's what we did and it was amazing, the view of sunset was stunning. We stopped at a couple different places and even made it out of the park area before dark. Maybe the sun sets a bit farther north so the observatory isn't always in the way but in December it sure was. I'm glad we chose to descend for some shots, This was worth the drive and even if you aren't keen on sunrise do this instead, Equally amazing!",

It was gorgeous with a gorgeous view this time, looking out all the way to West Maui, and south to the Big Island, but wow, the wind will almost blow you over! If you can hit up a ranger talk at the lookout tower at the very top, do go! It was very informative about native birds, ecotones, plants, geology, etc. And the lookout is glassed in and out of the wind. Love the silversword plants.

We loved the little town of Harper's Ferry! Positioned where the Potomac River meets the Shenandoah River. Three states, two rivers, one National Park!!! We had half expected it to be like a theme park - how wrong can you be. Park your car up the hill for $10, courtesy of the National Park, pick up their informative leaflet and hop on their shuttle bus, which takes you to the lower town. There are exhibits in many of the \"shops\" .....make sure you see the film on the history of the town in one of the first shops you come to on the right hand side, before you explore further afield. It really sets the scene for you in terms of how the town grew from its humble beginnings into such an important place in American history. Other must sees are John Brown''s fort and museum along with the site of the US Armoury, the \"Harper House\", the Catholic Church, Jefferson's Rock, the riverside, the pedestrian bridge to Maryland and the C&O Canal, the Appalachian Trail and the riversides. There are also cafes, restaurants and pubs as well as gift and craft shops in the two main streets up the hill. Take care as you wander the streets as motor vehicles are allowed in the town (limited parking). It really is a brilliant place to wander around and the history of it makes it even more special. Unfortunately, we did not have enough time to tour the battlefield as we were on route elsewhere. Don't make the same mistake!!! Give yourself a whole day to see everything!",

        "text": "This is where the slow slide toward Civil War became a strident March! In October of 1859 John Brown and 21 other abolitionists seized the armoury in this town and attempted to incite a slave rebellion in Virginia and throughout the South. The raid was put down after a siege by a detachment of Marines led by Colonel Robert E. Lee, and Brown was executed for treason against the State of Virginia. The town is at the confluence of the Shenandoah and Potomac rivers, and is 67 miles northwest of the Capitol in D.C. by way of I-270 and U.s. Highway 340 W. The Natioanl Park is open from 9 am to 5 pm, and the entrance fee is $10 per car. You park at the Visitor Center and take the Shuttle Bus into Harpers Ferry. One leaves every 15 minutes for the town. Once there the temptation is there to wonder what all the fuss s all about. But when you realise that the entire town is either a preservation or a replication, and when you look around at the hiking trails, the views and nature all around, you begin to understand what this Park is all about. There are many museums, gift shops, historical plaques and other exhibits describing various properties on High, Shenandoah, Potomac, and neighbouring streets. The Potomac Grille, Scoops Ice Cream and the Cannonball Deli are all excellent choices. You will wish that there was more air conditioning in these places, but remember - the town is 'preserved'! Lots of uneven surfaces and several steep paths and stairways. Harpers Ferry is about at the mid-point south to north on the Appalachian Trail, and visitors should take the short, steep walk up to Jefferson's Rock to take in the overview of both the town and the rivers. Take a walk along the B&O Canal, an historic portion of which is still there. Walk along the riverbank, or across the railroad trestle for other stunning views. And then there is the terrain itself, the woods and hills. Beautiful, and a big change from the barely rolling flats of the tidewater! Enjoy!",

We stayed on the KOA site which is at the entrance of Harpers ferry national park. It is only a very short drive from the camp ground to the visitors center, plenty of parking for cars and RVs. At the visitors center there is a large museum and film shows plus reenactments, after the visitors center a shuttle bus will take you to a Harpers ferry historic centre. Every thing is included in the parks entrance fee which is $10 per car or RV and all its passengers. It is really outstanding value.

There was an entrance fee of $10/car to enter the park. We took the short shuttle ride from the main entrance down to the riverfront, but in retrospect, had I understood that we could have driven ourselves and parked, I probably would have done the latter, as there was not much to see at the main visitor area. The shuttle ride did include a short audio introduction, though, and that was a nice touch. There were several exhibits housed in the individual buildings surrounding the riverfront, and the bookstore had lots of nice gifts and sundry items. The privately owned shops and restaurants seems quaint and fairly reasonably priced. There is a train station right in the town, so that would be a nice way to travel for a different spin. The Appalachian Trail runs right through the park, too, so I am looking forward to returning in warmer weather to explore at least a bit of that. Finally, I would just point out that there is a driving tour map available at the visitor centers, and we visited a few of those spots. Lots of history and beautiful scenery to experience.

Staying on site at Volcano House (see separate review), this was a terrific base from which to explore the natural beauty and devastation wrought by the island\u2019s still active volcanos. Hiring a car in Hilo provides the greatest flexibility as the park is considerable in size and, while cycling may be an option for the healthiest individuals, the distance between sites can be great. The visitor centre can provide more information on attractions (but beware some grumpy rangers trying to reduce expectations of seeing rivers of molten lava) however the maps provided are, strangely, not terribly intuitive. Cross referencing provided information with websites and commercially printed guides will give greater insight into which attractions cannot be missed. Jaggar observatory is a highlight, offering the closest (legal) views of the caldera and a nighttime visit will yield incredible views and photos of the lava glow, as is the chain of craters road which visits various sites of volcanic devastation in all its forms as well as the tourist-heavy Thurston Lava Tube. Trail walks vary from easy to intense, short to long. Don\u2019t expect to be seeing much in the way of close-up lava, as it is located in spaces far away from car parks and the main attractions and is, generally, a few hours walk each way. Also, food and drink options are low and expensive, so drop by a convenience store on the way to the park to grab water and snacks. Park entry is about $25 for a 7 day car pass. Also on site is an art gallery, sulphur and steam vents, loads of spectacular wild life (keep your eyes peeled) and walking trails to various lookouts. At least a full day of activity, if explored thoroughly without walking to the lava flows (that in itself would be a 4+ hour activity for fit individuals). ",

I don't know I slept all night after all the walking. I also appreciated that is was only $25 for the car load for an entire week. Very fair park fees. The restaurant in volcano house has an extremely limited menu so not good for kids.",

We paid $25, to a curt gate attendant, to get into the park only to find out the only place to access the flowing lava is from outside the park. Having paid the park fee we thought we should at least see what is there. First stop was the smolder crater. All you can see is the smoke coming off the lava lake and a huge caldera. Personally I did not find this too exciting. I did like the Jaggar Museum, it had some interesting, easy to understand displays. We then back tracked to a 4 mile hike that traversed the rim of an older caldera and then down one of the walls across the cooled lava and up the other side. Be sure to buy the $2 (after you have all ready paid the $25 entrance fee) guide book, the hike would be just a walk without it. It was OK but if asked I would say not worth the hour and a half. I have walked through a lava tube before but our friend had not so we did that. As far as educational value is it small. Really it is a walk through a dark tunnel???? The trek to where the lava spills into the ocean is long and would take a whole day so we did not do it. As far as the national park, unless you have a real interest in volcanos I would skip it.",

If we'd planned better, we could have combined this with other Parks in Hawaii, which would have been cost effective. We didn't have an up-to-date guidebook, so were a little surprised to find out that in the last 5 years the price has risen quite a lot (our book said $10, and it was $25 - not really expensive for what you get, but it was just the time scale).

The park rangers will also be able to guide you as to what you will see as sometimes dependant on weather, areas can be closed off or lava may not be seen. Well worth a trip! Make sure to bring suncream and plenty of water. If you do the 10 mile hike down to the lava flowing in to the sea they recommend 3 litres of water per person and torches as well.

Cost to enter the park was $20 for our family in a car and gave us access for seven days. We only had enough time to visit for a few hours, but will come back on our next trip. Parking around the site was a challenge, but with patience we managed to locate a spot to park. If you're willing to walk a little ways you can park wherever you like and hike to whatever you want to see, and for those that are more mobility challenged there are quite a few parking areas spread throughout the park. The map you receive when you enter shows various locations of interest and different trails including trail lengths and vantage points. We plan to visit the Island with my elderly parents in the coming years, and they love to get out and explore, but due to health issues we need to be careful how for out we take them. This park is great for that because there are plenty of short, easy, well managed trails to walk that have wonderful vantage points to take in the craters, and the flora and fauna. The lava tube is also very accessible. Most of the trails we hiked were well covered, and provided ample shade. Bring water and snacks as there doesn't seem to be much near the park in the way of shops/restaurants, and you'll have to drive to access these services. ",

In order to view the lava flow there is a 4 mile one way gravel path at the end of the highway. You can rent a bike or walk however we decided to walk and it took us 1 hour 15 minutes on the way there. My kids are 11 and 15 and they were fine. Take lots of water and there is a port-a-loo halfway there. The bikes were $20pp and would take you 40 minutes one way but it may be a little challenging on the way back if you are staying late at the lava flow. There were also tandem bikes and bikes with baby carts on the back. We viewed the lava flow between 6pm and 7pm and it was amazing. I highly recommend coming at sunset. I had seen reviews stating this was an extreme hike but it wasn't the case. If my 11 year old can do it I'm sure you can too.

The park costs $20 per car entry however the pass is good for 7 days. Start at the information centre and speak with one of the friendly and knowledgeable guides for advice on what parts/features/trails will best suit your time, needs and fitness abilities. They were more than happy to tailor walks for us so that we made the most of our time there. We did the crater hike which was out of this world! You descend 500ft into a crater that used to be a lava lake. The hardened lava has dried in the swirling shapes and patterns of the original flow and you can see up close plenty of different types of lava rock. We felt like we were in an alien landscape and the mist and rain made it all the more surreal. Watch out for the steam vents, these can scald you if you get too close - stick to the trail. Tungsten lava tube was an easy hike and pretty good as far as lava tubes go! Steam pots and lava lake spurts visible from the Jagger museum were AWESOME. However, our highlight was definitely down the other end of the park along the coastline. You can see where brand new lava flow has literally created new land and experience crashing waves against pitch black lava cliffs. From the arch, you can hike into the latest ongoing eruption from Kileaua. Lava is spouting from the cliff side directly into the ocean and forming new land. The steam is out of this world and it hot (obviously!) This hike is tough, about 16km round trip - no trail and over sharp and treacherous lava. Sturdy shoes needed and plenty of water, it will take you around 5hrs so if you are going in the afternoon, take a torch. Be prepared for the heat bouncing back off the black lava too and take sunscreen! To finish off we visited the Peroglyphs which are a great insight into the history of the indigenous people who lived and survived in this harsh environment. This is a short and easy walk and very interesting. We could've spent our full week here however time did not allow it! Be prepared for all weather conditions - we experienced sun, rain, fog, mist, wind and humidity with a temperature range of 16-31oC. I highly recommend a visit to the Volcanoes National Park.

We paid $25 as a car to get into the national park which isn't a big deal. Bring lots of water, a jacket as its a bit cooler up here and a rain coat: good chance you'll get wet! The Ranger at the information center was very helpful telling us exactly where the best areas would be to go, breaking down how long we wanted to spend there and what hiking trails would suit our desires. The Thurston lava tube was a very easy and short walk through pretty rainforest, and the Jagger viewing platform was brilliant. Our view of the Lava spitting 3 stories into the sky although quite far away was spectacular and humbling. We then drove out of the national park on the Rangers suggestion and went down to the end of highway 130, where we hired bicycles for $10 an hour. The 13km round trip ended up taking us about 3 hrs but that includes over an hour of walking on lava fields and watching where the lava was flowing into the ocean with a billowing cloud of steam. If you're not worried about riding back in the dark, stay until nightfall like we did- that's when things really heat up and the glow of the lava truly intensifies.

I left behind the planned visits of the overlook and cold trail hiking and decided to hike the 10 miles roundtrip to the hot lava flows with my family, whatever it took. It was an amazing adventure. The first portion of the hike is from the gate at the end of the chain of crater road, using the chain of crater gravel service road, a nice and easy but very hot walk (still better than through the jungle). Then when about square with the smoke, we walked up on the cold lava fields to the hot lava flow. You can feel the warmth from quite a distance so its not like you can step on hot lava by mistake. I had previously made myself a wooden stick from a dead branch so we were able to poke red lave as we wished. It's a unique and amazing experience, finally we are able to see lava up close instead of seeing it from 5 miles away. It is very slow moving flow so there is no risks unless you jump into it. Still, secure procedures and good sense must be used when approaching and playing with red hot lava. The heat is so strong anyway that you cannot really stay close to it for a long time. We were also lucky to meet a geologist at the site that was giving a private lecture to 2 guys who must have hired him at great expense. He showed us quite a few tricks. We stayed with the lava for about one hour and then walk the 5 miles back to the car. It is preferable to do it very early in the morning from the park (much less people), or later at night from the Kalapana direction (shorter but lots of people), avoiding the noon sun as much as possible. I drank 2.5 litres of water during the 5 hours journey. I have memories, pictures and stories for a lifetime, all for a $20 entry fee for the car.

There are many scenic stops throughout with parking and walks to suit any level of fitness (My 75yo Aunt did the Thurston Lava Tube walk). If you do nothing else, visit this park. You can keep up with Volcanic activity through the Hawaii Volcanos Observatory service. Dry days are best as rain will cause the crater to steam up making it difficult to see.",

After we had seen lava flows and craters and vents from the air, we hired two cars to see them up close. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Volcano National Park. Be aware there is a $20 per car entry fee to the national park, but that gives you 7 consecutive days' access. First the Visitor centre, which was well presented, and had lovely staff who were knowledgeable and enthusiastic. Next we drove to the steam vents, and did a short walk in that area, enjoying the views from the lookout there. Then we went up to the Jaggar museum. Kids and adults alike were thrilled by the view of the Kilauea crater complete with bubbling lava, and the information in the museum was well presented, interesting, and helpful. Kids loved the seismograph and spent quite some time trying to make their own seismic event go \"off the scale\". We had plenty of time, so we then headed down the Chain of Craters Road to the sea. The drive was spectacular, and in excellent condition. We stopped to walk through the Thurston Lava Tube, which was a short hike which the kids managed quite happily. There were some steep spots though which may cause problems for the less mobile visitors -it is a mountain trail of course!",

After that walk through the extinct lava tube (Thurston Lava Tube). The whole trip is less than 3 hours. If you have another 3-4 hours to spare, drive to the lava-buried village of Kalapana and along the coastline of Puna. I am sure you will enjoy the scenic ride.",

This beach is amazing and I will write about it in another review. The road is very safe and it took one more hour to get to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. It costs only $15 per car, valid for 7 days, and there is so much amazing places to see, feel and smell in this park. We went first to the Kilauea Visitor Center: very interesting, staff very courteous and quite nice souvenirs to buy. We found an excellent book on Hawaii's fishes that we had been searching for a long time (Hawaiian Reef Fishes. Sea Turtles, dolphins, whales and seals). We then did the Thurston Lava Tube and it was really fun and spectacular. It was quite cold at 50F with great winds. We were wearing our hot winter clothes and as a joke, some people offered us to rent them!!! :) Afterwards, we went down the Chain of Craters Road. Quite amazing to see all the different craters and surroundings of different sizes and shapes. On our back, we stopped at Steam Vents and it was very surprising to smell and see the vapors (SO2-sulfur dioxide) coming out of the ground. After this, we went to the Jaggar Museum. The lady at reception was extremely nice and showed us the real time 4 computers of the crater and explained to us that we would see a spectrum of orange lights at the crater rim after sunset. We took a nap in the car and at 7:00 pm we went to see this amazing site with different shades of orange light from the lava in the crater. We would have liked to see the lava but I think that we we can only see it from the sky. Coming back to Kona took 2.5 hours and it was easy and confortable. I would go back again to walk around the many trails and go to the Volcano House for a meal but there is so many beautiful sites on the Big Island that we will continue our different adventures on the Big Island.",

Only a handful of people at that time of day & it was full moon too so some stunning views of nature doing her thing. I would recommend starting at the visitor centre just inside the park to get your bearings, then the other visitor centre at the Jaggar Museum. From there you get the closest view of the smouldering crater. Be aware you won't see lava erupting out of it at the moment, just sulphurous smoke. At night it takes on the red glow and is more atmospheric. I think the 3hr hike through Mauna Iki crater beats it (make sure you buy the $2 guide from the trailhead first), and we also did Mauna Ulu hike. The drive down Chain of Craters road to the petroglyphs is lovely & almost no-one around when we did it. Staff are very knowledgeable and helpful.

The drive from the Hilo Hawaiian hotel is where I stayed is basically a straight road. A 45 minute drive roughly. We drove there ourselves. Headed to the park by about 4pm. $10/car to get in and valid for 10 days. As I was told best time to be at the National Volcano Park is about around the 4-5pm. Enough time for you trek through the Lava Tube, then go the other part where you see the smoke coming out from the lava.For family's that have infants or toddlers. There are 3 parkades. The 3rd lower parkade is the closest Lava tube. It was quite cold once we got the Kaileau crater observation station. Not sure what the temperature would be in the summer. The lava started glowing at about 6:45pm and got more brighter as it got darker. ",

The hike was led by a voluntary guide. The loop trail is just over 4 miles. It has different starting points. We hiked past the ohia forest, then descended down to the lava bathtub below. There is molten magma still beneath the surface. Along the way there were rock cairns to direct hikers. We found the ascend from the crater's east end to the rim exhausting. It took us two and half hours for the hike. I would classified the hike as moderate in difficulty. The second day we visited the steam vents, Jaggers Museum, walked the Thurston Lava tube and drove down the Chain of Craters road to see the petroglyph and the numerous places of interest. On the third day we watched a hula and mele (dance & chant) performance, organised by the Volcano Art Centre. It was a magnificent show and free of charge. The Volcano Art Centre organises performances once a month, usually on the third or fourth Saturday. The Art Centre is one of the best small art centres we have visited. There were some beautiful wood and glass exhibits, as well as photos and jewellery. Prices are very reasonable. We left the park to have lunch at a small cafe in Volcano called Cafe Ohi'a, good food at very reasonable price. After the refreshment we drove to Punaluu Black Sand Beach, about 30 miles south. We also saw five green turtles nesting there. We returned to the park, did some shopping at the Art Centre and finished with a drink at the Volcano House, which has magnificent view.",

We were here on a sunny day right after days of rain so they were really letting off steam! We went to jagger museum and saw the Kilauea crater which was fantastic, didn't see any lava but saw plenty of smoke. It would be amazing to be here at night as it has a red glow to the volcano. The road from jagger museum to the other side of the crater was closed due to volcanic activity. We then went to the thurston lava tube I was hesitant about going in these lava tubes as I thought it may be claustrophobic but it was fine! The tube could fit a large car inside them and it was well lit up and an amazing feeling. We drove past and stopped at a few pit craters and drove down to the 2003 lava that blocked the road off near the ocean lava was everywhere it was incredible too see!! We spent 4.5 hours in the park and I think that's the absolute minimum time you should spend here to really enjoy everything. It is a $10 fee to enter per car valid for 7 days that goes toward improving the park. One tip is they have a few places to get a beverage but not anywhere to eat we were starving when we left so bring some snacks at minimum! ",

Rainforests, lava tunnels, steam vents, hiking down into the crater, exploring the formations and steaming cracks, and then hiking back up - an accomplishment but well worth the effort. It was an overcast day (our helicopter tour was cancelled) so we spent much more time in the VNP and enjoyed every second. I actually don't know how we would have made the trek back up if it wasn't for the overcast skies and the light mist in the air. It is not for elderly or those with a disability. Such an interesting adventure for any age and any member of the family. The rangers are top notch and so good at directing you to the exact right excursion for your skill set and interests.",

The trail starts behind the Volcano House. A word of warning, the hike takes you 425 feet down to the caldera floor, it's not bad going down but coming back up was a bit more difficult, the equivalent of climbing the stairs of a 35 story building.

We left the park around 8 p.m. and took hwy 11 back to Kona, taking 2 hrs 15 mins. On arriving we went for a short walk with a Ranger which was very informative. Crater Rim drive was closed at the Jagger Museum so after spending some time in the museum and viewing area, we drove back, stopped at the Thurston Lava tube then onto Chain of Craters Road. Park signage could be better as a few times we stopped at areas that didn't seem to be much but turned out to be really worthwhile.... 1969-1974 Mauna Ulu lava flows for one.... short walk from parking lot. Went as far as we could go on Chain of Craters road...to the 2003 lava flows and walked on some of the youngest land on earth.... where the lava flowed across the road. In the distance on the shoreline, we could just about see some steam where the lava is presently entering the ocean. Went back to the Jagger Museum stopping at the Military Camp for Starbucks (Yes!) coffee.... they also serve good food at the camp. The Jagger Museum car park filled up very quickly around 6p.m. and people had to park in the overflow parking lot a short walk away, but by about 7.30 p.m. it was half empty.... perhaps because the temperatures had dropped considerably and it was cold... bring a jacket. Awesome to see the glowing flume cloud at night. So much to see for only $10 per vehicle! My only regret is we didn't get time to hike the Kilauea Iki trail which I really wanted to do.... will have to go again!!! If we were to go again, I would make this trail a priority and maybe stop off at the military camp for dinner before heading up to the Jagger Museum (around 8p.m.) for nighttime viewing of Kilauea. Apart from driving through pouring rain in Hilo area, the weather in the park was sunny and warm.... shorts and t-shirt.... although around about 5p.m. a fleece and/or jacket plus gloves was needed.",

The advertising site showed photos of smoke and red lava-flow and also indicated that a spectacular night-tour was available. I took this to imply that we had a chance of seeing some lave. Wrong! we were collected by coach from our hotel and then waited for two and a half hours at the airport before flying to the Big Island to be told immediately by our driver on the ground that we would not be seeing any lava-flow that day or any other. A bit late to cancel then. What followed was a coach trip around the Big Island visiting some sights but mainly spent long stops at souvineer-type attractions and the worst lunch I have ever struggled to force down. We did see the crater and some steam at one point but this stop was around 10% of the total time. At the end of our tour, the driver said we were very early for our flight back and did we want to roam around the shopping mall? Er, no! A complete waste of time and money. On return I complained to Viator who managed to obtain a partial refund ( everything but flight costs).

Tours begin roughly every 30 minutes, and begin with an orientation by Rangers in the south wing. From there you go to the Supreme Courth of Pennsylvania (not the U.S.) room, and then across the central hallway to the room we all want to see - where the Declaration of Independence and Constitution were debated, edited and signed. Upstairs you will visit the Long Gallery, a reception area, the Governor's Council Chambers, and another room sometimes used for Committee meetings, the U.S. Marshall's Office, and a storeroom. Ironically and very sadly, fugitive slaves were sometimes held for trial here - the irony is that this very room is directly over the room in which the Declaration and Constitution were dealt with! After this tour, you exit out of Independence hall and join another line, this one to tour the first House of Representatives and Senate Chambers - located in the adjacent building immediately to the North of Independence Hall. The House is on ground level. The Senate Chamber is upstairs. It was in this House Chamber that the first peaceful transition from one democratically elected government to another took place (1796, Washington to Adams). The truly shocking thing to me was how small (literally cozy) the Senate was! All in all, this is a must see for visitors to Philly. Open 9-5, very close and convenient parking, many eateries nearby, excellent gift shops in all locations. Certainly not the only things to see in this city, but an excellent start. Enjoy!",

We took the scenic tour ($24 total for the 4 of us) and it was about 1.5 hrs. The ranger who led it was informative, interesting and funny. You take an elevator down to start the tour and there are lots of steps up/down but it was totally manageable for us. There was one woman in our tour who had asthma and hadn't brought her inhaler and she was having trouble, but everyone else was fine. The tour goes ~350 feet underground and though it's dark you can see some need things (though there are very few stalagtites/stalagmites here).

It was extremely windy at the outlook and my husband almost lost his hat. We backtracked to Hidden Valley and did a spin through the campground. A little further down the road is the trail to Barker Dam. Be sure to see the petroglyphs near the end of the loop. It was an easy walk, about a two mile loop. Next stop was by Jumbo Rocks to see the Skull Rock. We then drove south to the Cholla Cactus Garden. It was so pretty. Most of the cacti were flowering. There are brochures at the start of the 1/4 mile trail loop to explain things as you walk through. We turned back north and exited the park at Twentynine Palms.

Some could be climbed on if you had the right equipment, but most visitors were content to hike around the trails at the base and gawk or take pictures. The Joshua trees themselves are very weird; tree shaped with branches and trunks, but with cactus like growths at the ends of each branch.

Wish we had allowed ourselves more time as we missed seeing a couple of the places we had highlighted. Make sure you get there early if you only have one day to explore, there is so much to see. I believe the visitor centers open at 8:00 a.m. Admission to the park is extremely reasonable, $15.00 per vehicle and is good for 7 consecutive days. We would have saved a lot of time if we had gone in at the west entrance station (Joshua Tree Visitor Center) instead of the north entrance (Oasis Visitor Center). Of course we missed the first entrance and ended up entering and exiting from the north which made for having to do some backtracking once in the park. Would recommend starting out with the hike at Hidden Valley. This is an easy, 1 mile loop that circles the interior of a small valley surrounded by tall rocks that serve as an excellent bouldering arena. Some beautiful rock formations and we did see a few climbers. From Hidden Valley, drive up to Keys View and take some pictures. There is a 1.2 mile hike you can do there as well from Keys View to Inspiration Peak but we didn't have enough time. From Keys View head towards Jumbo Rocks and Skull Rock. We missed stopping at Jumbo Rocks but we did get out at Skull Rock to take a few pictures. From there drive to the parking lot at Split Rock Trail. This hike is often overlooked as it isn't as publicized as some of the others, but it is so worth doing. It is an easy 2+ mile loop with some amazing rocks that are even more beautiful in the afternoon sun. These were all the areas we saw while at the park, but if we'd had a bit more time, I would have liked to finish off by seeing Arch Rock and taking a walk around the Cholla Cactus Garden. Maybe next time! All the Joshua trees throughout this park are pretty amazing to see as well. Don't miss out on visiting this park if you are vacationing in the Palm Springs area.",

We stopped along the way to visit many sites of interest and viewing areas. The Keys View vista had a stunning view of the valley. Along the Western part of the drive there were many, many Joshua Trees. Most were not blooming yet. In the Eastern part of the drive, the elevation decreases and the climate changes and the Joshua trees disappear. We saw blooming Ocotillo cacti and lots of windflowers. The Cholla Cactus Garden was stunning. We didn't hike because we had our elderly parents with us, but we would definitely return to do some hiking!",

The first is empty and forbidding but the different shades of light make it quite beautiful. Passing through the boulders that divide the two regions, there are plentiful Joshua Trees to admire - again in a beautiful if very different environment. We spent around 4 hours there but we could have easily spent far longer. And if you're into hiking there are obviously some great trails to spread over a few days. The vantage point at Keyes View is certainly worth the short detour for a view over the valley. And the road surface is (largely) amongst the best you'll find in California!",

Got a pretty good look at the San Andreas fault from one of the high vantage points. Make sure you take food and water with you as there's no food for purchase in the park. One word of advice - if you've come in at the West gate, probably best to go back out the west gate when you want to leave. My husband decided to go all the way out to the east end, and the road is torturously winding and curvy (much worse than the Road to Hana!) Note that there is a $15 fee per car to enter the park.",

        "text": "A little info to share. There are 3 ways down to the town. You can hire a mule group to ride the trail and a lunch along with a guided tour will be included. You can fly a small plane from top side to the little strip below, again joining an escorted tour. Lastly, you can hike down and back to connect with your guided tour. There are also combinations of the choices such as walk down, fly out, etc. The tour for us was $60 each cash only. No pets or kids under 16 allowed at the bottom. We are a mid 60s couple who like to hike but are not rabid hikers. We chose to do the hike round trip. We flew in for the day from Maui and got a rental car from Alamo at the airport for $70. There are cabs and maybe Uber but with spotty cell service especially at the trail head we wanted to control the transportation. That also allowed us to be flexible on time and have food/drink and a change of dry clothes waiting. You must make arrangements with a tour group or National Park service BEFORE visiting. Mule tours will make the arrangements or \"permit\" for you. As hikers we paid $60 each cash only to the van driver and signed our name on the \"permit\" sheet. Done deal, signs everywhere announce $500 fine for hiking without a permit but the catch is we had to hike down to get the \"permit\" ---Crazy Hawaii! We went to Google to find a tour connection. Father Damien Tours was chosen. We called and our names were put on the reservation list. No deposit was taken nor confirmation # given. After hanging up we were a little apprehensive as to whether that was it, it was very casual. Now the hike. The trail head is not clearly marked. Look for parked cars on the right side of the road just past the mule corral, I believe just past mile marker 5. Park next to one of the parked cars and lock up. If you enter the adjacent state park with overlook you have gone a little too far. Start as early as you can for several reasons: beat the mules and their droppings, they start out around 9am. The early hours on the trail are cooler and more peaceful which also allows you to pace yourself yet still arrive early. Tour vans will pickup either the mule group or the hikers at the bottom of the trail at the mule corral at 10am and wait a few minutes or so for any hiker on the reservation list that has not arrived. There are two separate tour groups. We were very happy with our guide Steve. He was a long time Hawaiian resident, retired Navy guy how also likes to teach history. And the van was brand new not the old school bus seen in the web site. The tour lasted about 3 hours which includes a lunch break. Be sure to pack your own lunch and water for the day as the little store in town has limited supplies. Drinking water and restrooms are located in several locations during the tour. Speaking of water we started the hike with 3 water containers. We drank often as you sweat like you are in a sauna. Hard exercise and 95% humidity mixed with 80 degrees. There are 26 numbered switch backs on the trail. We stashed water near one of the switch back signs for the hike back. We chose #7 as it would be 2/3 the way up and the number was easy to remember. You do stuff like that when you get old! Hiking down took 90 minutes. The trails is steep but has block and concrete steps all the way. Molokai is a wet place. You need to look before stepping over rocks and puddles. Walking steep trails downhill will leave you sore in unused muscles for days after. We used adjustable snow shoe poles to help balance which proved indispensable. We disassemble the lite weight poles so they could fit in our carry on bag. Mokulele Airlines was not as picky as the larger companies about sharp objects or water bottles. At 2:30pm tour over and we started back. There were 7 hikers that hiked down, 2 took the flight back. At 4:30 we were topside, dripping wet but felt we had really earned this memory.",

There are a ton of signs that say you need a written permit to hike down ($500 fine) but we just paid Gloria, who runs the bar at the leper colony and that seemed to work fine. Her phone # is 808 567 6171 and she charged us $25 pp. Not sure if this was only to walk around the leper colony or for that + the hike. There are 2 tour companies that monopolize the hike but the USA National Park service people who were working on the trail were nice and didn\u2019t seem to care about permits. In summary, it was nice, but probably not worth the money. I certainly wouldn\u2019t pay $70 pp to do a self guided muddy hike. The cliffs are supposedly the highest sea cliffs in the world.

However, the best part of the experience was the helicopter flight from the \"topside\" airport at Moloka'i to the air field at Kalaupapa, having a close view of the sea cliffs. And then the flight back from Kalaupapa to topside via Maui. The view of the Pali coast from the air was totally amazing (could never describe in words), followed from the aerial view of Halawa Valley, and on the return from Maui of the barrier reef along the coast and the many historic fish ponds along the south-east coast of the island.

But for the real views like the sea turtles and fishponds, be prepared to earn them. Two loop trails take you to the turtles and follow the lava lined beach. They are not well marked except at the start and as they cross each other. Take plenty of water, head covering, sunblock and real hiking shoes that lace and support your ankles. After getting to the sea you might see several sea turtles napping in the shallow and tidal pools. Stay at least 20 feet away from the protected turtles. The trails from there on are on rough lava rock. Pay attention to the evidence that others have walked in that direction as the lava in many areas gives little clues as to the route. With the ocean to your back and the highway overlooking the visitors center to get your bearings, the shorter of the two hikes will take you 2-2.5 hours.

Rocks in the intermediate and advanced caves will be closer to you (sometimes forcing you to crouch or even crawl) and so you should wear long sleeves, long trousers, knee pads, gloves and sturdy boots. You will also need head protection and some lighting source. The Visitor Center sells helmets at reasonable prices, and checks out flashlights which must be returned the same day. Now don't lose hope. There are three 'beginner's caves' to chose from: the mush pot cave very close to the Visitor Center, with it's own lighting, and a prepared floor, enabling disabled access; the Golden Dome cave, also near the Center; and the Valentine Cave in the southeast of the park.

Open 8:30-5 daily except Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's. There is a Visitor Parking lot just south of the Visitor Center ($2 per hour). Leave any large bags in your trunk. Unfortunately, street parking is only a maximum of 2 hours per day. Arrive early - honestly this should be your first stop on any tour of Lincoln sites in Springfield. If you arrive after 1 pm there is a distinct possibility that you may not get house-tour tickets! Tours are free, but you must have time-stamped tickets to join the tour. So as soon as you enter the Visitor Center, get those tickets! If you have a long wait, you can view the videos, browse the gift shop, or rest in the benches under the trees along the street. A four block area of homes surrounding Lincoln's home has been preserved, so you can also take a look in these. When we visited, 3 of them were open. Preserving the Neighborhood and not just the home gives you a feel for what the area was like in the 1850s. Tours are guided, last 20-25 minutes, and begin just outside the home. The tour itself consists of the parlour, sitting room, dining room and kitchen on the ground floor. On the second floor you see the bedrooms of Mr. Lincoln, Mrs. Lincoln, eldest son Robert, younger sons Willie and Tad, and the bedroom of the housekeeper. I thought the kitchen was the most interesting. What a lot of work using those 'primitive' means to provided family meals. Poor housekeeper! But I was wrong as far as the most intriguing spot in the house was concerned. On the way up the stairs, the guide said that the railing on the stairs was the original, used by all in the family including Mr. Lincoln. To my knowledge this is the ONLY presidential home/museum that allows 'ordinary tourists' to routinely touch something used Routinely by someone of Lincoln's stature! Enjoy! ",

The bus took people from Lyndon B Johnson's boyhood home in Johnson City then to his Ranch in Stonewall, Tx. It is approximately 14 miles apart. We have seen the transformation of this historical site. I remember seeing Ms. Lady Bird outside their house while our tour bus was passing thru. Now that she has passed, we take self tours with our out of town visitors. It is very easy and convenient. You stop at the LBJ Boyhood home in Johnson City first then drive to the ranch. We stop at the visitor center to pick up a CD which will instruct and guide you throughout the park in the convenience of your private car and company of family and friends. The LBJ house is partially open now. Every year, they add a room or two available for public to see. A nominal fee of $2.00 or $3.00 is paid prior to entering the house. It is educational. The place history buffs will enjoy. Donations are accepted. There is a drop box for the CD at the end of the tour. You do not even have to go back to the Visitor Center. How cool is that?",

The house has been restored to the way it was during Johnson's presidency and a $3 ticket gets a quick tour with basic information of the main floor. There is not much time to really look at things, but the tour guides answer questions. Groups are moved through the house quickly, but you can take as much time as you want wandering around the property, seeing the oak tree under which Johnson held meetings (one quarter of his presidency was spent here so the run way was well used by those meeting with him here rather than in Washington), the river bank where barbecues with top entertainment for up to 1500 people were held, the garages with glass sides providing easy viewing of Johnson cars etc. Very interesting were the cement slabs on which guests to the ranch \"wrote\" their names. It was fun finding names of other presidents, politicans, entertainers, astronauts etc. Our only downer was leaving the park at closing time when we stopped almost at the gate, hoping to take a quick final picture from the car. A car with a guide pulled up beside us and told us to leave immediately as she was locking the gate and we would have to call 911 to get out!

Really. We bussed to the roughly hewn entrance. Initially the cave is dry with few formations, but as we got lower, it became wetter, with more formations like stalactites and mites. There are a few domes and a pit at 250' where the tour stopped to learn about the history of the place. Water flows below. Temperature is pretty constant and earthquakes don't affect the place. The Drapery Room looks like pleated drapes, the Snowball Room looks like hundreds of shimmering snowballs in the light and Frozen Niagara looks like a smaller frozen version of its namesake. I saw some small black bats, long legged spiders and a pale centipede like insect. There are cave drawings etched on some walls. Since my visit, I learnt that slaves helped build the place and are buried near the entrance including the first guide, Stephen Bishop. Many died within from TB and the work. The caves are considered one of the largest human haunts in the world. Mummified remains have been found dating back centuries.

We took the self guided discovery tour which is always available (and much cheaper, at $13.00 for a family of four). It turns out this was probably best because our kids (particularly the six year old) would have had trouble enjoying a longer tour. In this tour, they got to run from spot to spot, hearing the few guides positioned throughout the cave, sharing its history. I had taken the tour as a child and remembered other parts of the cave, so I was a bit disappointed that I wasn't able to see them. However, having happy kids was probably more important to my enjoyment of the cave this time around. The park is gorgeous as well, with tiny streams trickling down the mossy rocks of the ravine. The kids saw another child wearing a gold plastic badge and asked about it at the information booth. The park has a fun program for the kids to complete an age based number of workbook exercises about conservation and cave history to become a Junior Ranger, complete with oath, certificate, and badge. This, my children will always remember, and they learned about conservation from the many exhibits in the visitor center!",

Some drinks and coffee and a muffin available to go with the guides chat. The guide did her best to make this long slog back interesting. Probably a unique trip but at the price of $369.95 EACH was in my opinion not nearly worth it. Made a formal representation to our cruise operator (HAL) who obtained a response from the operator that ours was the first complaint, that the boat was less than year old boat and was fitted with HD tv.

I was wrong. This is a major advantage, at no cost to the park, in allowing large numbers of visitors to come to Mt Rushmore in a convenient way. The parking was very efficient and your $11 fee covers as many visits in a calendar year than you can manage. I used it for three separate visits over a 4 day period. The public areas are scaled to meet the expected visitor numbers so did not seem overly crowded and a walk around the Presidents Trail thins things out further. I would recommend this for novel views of the presidents. The exhibits create a sense of the undertaking to sculpt the heads and the evening illumination ceremony was worth coming in for. I notice a comment about it being cool in the evening, yes that's true so bring a sweater or a jacket and don't miss Mt Rushmore illuminated.

I've always wanted to visit there ever since I was a kid, so this was a dream finally come true! Mount Rushmore is beautiful. I was almost star struck seeing the presidents carved onto the giant rocks. Touring through the museum underground and learning the history behind this massive structure, you really are awe struck by how they were able to pull such an amazing feat off! Parking cost $15 all day. Admission is free since it is a national monument. Fairly close to area hotels in Keystone (about 15-20 min drive away). There are several other national monuments/parks/caves nearby, but this takes the cake for sure! I highly highly recommend if you live in this country, you visit this place at least once before you pass onto the next world. You will not regret it! A++++",

We got there in plenty of time but were surprised how small the actual sculpture was. There was a large crowd waiting for the ceremony to start but the lead up to dusk was disappointing. Music and a gentleman who spoke at length about the importance of the memorial in U.S. history. It became obvious that there was a problem as no illumination of the sculpture took place and eventually we were told that there was a malfunction with the power supply. There were clearly thunderstorms in the area but surely that was insufficient to interrupt the occasion? Finally we were told that the presentation had been abandoned so everybody started to leave. As we headed for our bus, suddenly the lights came on and everybody rushed back to view the scene. Unfortunately, the illumination was poor and the sculpture barely visible. We were bitterly disappointed as we had travelled thousands of miles to see this icon of the USA and were moving on the next morning on the next stage of our road trip.

I highly recommend walking the Presidential Trail (422 stairs) which gets you ~right under the monument and gives some great photo ops, as well as trekking out to the Sculptor's Studio (where we were fortunate to catch a ranger presentation that explained more about how the mountain was carved).

The evening show is excellent. Host from National Park Service was great. Short movie on the Presidents and history including First Nations. Altogether a very emotional evening culminating in the National Anthem and lowering the Flag. Armed Forces Veterans invited on stage for the finale. Recommended for all Americans. And Canadians!",

The only critique I have is that while the giant ice cream cone was delicious, the portion size was too large for all three of us (my husband, niece, and myself).

It's truly huge and amazing to imagine how it was carved. The site is well organized and nicely layed out too. It's technically free but $11/car to park (so I suppose if you walked there it would truly be free ;) but totally worth the money. Seeing it from a distance as you drive up is cool too. When you get there and park, you walk in to an area with all the state flags, which is nice, and then out to a platform that overlooks the amphitheatre (there is a show there at night but we didn't go). Lots of people take photos there but it's crowded and there is a better photo spot later. The Presidential Trail walk is worth doing - it's easier (fewer stairs) if you start it from the left (when looking at the amphitheatre). It takes you closer to the monument and also passes the sculptor's studio, which is interesting. At the end there is a path to the right to an overlook that is a better place for photos. Also, the gift store here is great (and the day we were there, there was a man there who had actually worked on the monument so we got to meet him!).

Admission to it was free, but parking cost $11 and is good for the rest of the year. The facilities here are on great shape, and looked virtually new. The staff said that it was a slow-ish day there, but with the crowds of people, I would hate to be there on a busy day. I would have liked to see more history of the presidents depicted in the monument. Being a foreigner, I have never taken any American History courses, but I felt like I walked away learning more about the sculpture than the men he so carefully crafted. Having something like a rock carving demonstration or more interactive exhibits of the construction of it would have been nice. We only spent about 2 hrs there, and then came back at night for the illumination ceremony which was a disappointment. They basically just played the same video that loops in the exhibit hall, and slowly turned the lights on. Unless you're already there, I wouldn't go back there for that part. It would also have been nice if there was a restaurant on site, not just a burger-shack. We were pretty burger'd out by that point on a road trip. I'm glad I went once, but it wasn't the highlight of my trip.",

This park really takes into consideration everything that you might think of. They are environmentally conscious, have very good food selections too. It is a great place to sit in the open space and read a book or listen to your MP3 player. Then you can reflect on the beauty of this sculpture. I strongly recommend everyone do the audio tour which will share a lot of insider tidbits with you. Without the audio you will miss so much about the history of the location and the people's stories along with it and might be tempted to say this was 'boring'. We arrived at 11am and didn't leave until 4pm. I truly didn't think the day would fly by so quickly. The gift shop offers some amazing items Made in the USA also. A nice touch given everything imported from overseas nowadays. Treat yourself to an American piece of history. PS all you pay is $11 for parking and you get to use the pass for 1 year.",

It is a self guided 6 block walking tour, or you can rent mountain bikes to go farther. Stone carvings of 43 Presidents, costs about $8 person. On to Deadwood. What a fun place to walk around on another self-guided tour! Allow at least 3 hours to see town [free], Mt Moriah Cemetary [$1 per person] and visit some casinos and have lunch. There are staged shoot-outs on the Main Street at 2pm. We ate lunch at the Iron Horse. My husband chose all day breakfast, I had grilled chicken salad [$15 USD with tax & tip] . Friendly staff, good food. At Mt Moriah we saw graves of Wild Bill Hickock, Calmity Jane, and Potato Johnny. 3 Eights and 2 Aces was the hand Wild Bill was holding when he was shot by the dirty scoundrel Jack McCall. On to Hill City to shop at the Quilt Corral of Mistletoe Ranch. Very friendly and helpful staff and wonderful selection of fabrics. We opted to stay on Hwy 16 [no park fee] rather than take the Needles Highway through Custer State Park [$5 person]. Hwy 16 has the pigtail bridges and the 3 tunnels, with Mt Rushmore framed in the exit of the last tunnel. Be aware that there is a lot of braking, tight, winding curves and narrow roads. Great scenery, saw buffalo, deer, mountain goats. Mt Rushmore [$8 parking fee] is very impressive. As you walk toward the mountain you pass thru the Avenue of Flags, every state and territory is represented. The town of Keystone is very, very commercialized. We opted to overnight in Rapid City.",

This is a very interesting site for those interested in the history of the original inhabitants of Hawaii (or the second inhabitants if you count the mythical menehune). Get the brochure near the washrooms or you will have to guess at what everything is. The only signs (other than number posts that match descriptions on the brochures) are the signs telling you to stay off the rock walls. The place of refuge as it's called locally (since pu'uhonua o honaunau is a bit of a mouthfull!) was the place you went if you broke the \"kapu\" rules that guided Hawaiian life until Christianity became more dominant. Pretty much every rule was punishable by death. If you could make it to the City of Refuge, a Kahuna could have you perform rituals to clean the slate for you and you could return home. The rules ranged from fishing or hunting in places that had been placed off limits to allow stocks to replenish to allowing your shadow to fall on an Ali'i (royalty) since this would offend the gods and cause an earthquake, volcanic eruption or tsunami.

They will also indicate on your park tour map where his company was positioned during the fighting making your visit a very personal one. There is an excellent display that brings the battles to life with the use of a model of the battlefield and LEDs. There are displays showing uniforms, etc. and a nice gift shop. For a small fee of $5.00 you purchase a park driving pass (valid for 6 consecutive days) and set off to explore the park on your own. There are ten stops where you get out of your car and walk to a small interpretive board that explains what you are viewing. The signage is minimal so it helps if you have done some pre-reading about the battles that occurred here. There is also no indication of how far you have to walk and whether the trail is a loop back to the car or a trail into the park. The British and American fortified lines are clearly marked with stakes so orientation to battle landmarks is fairly easy. Allow 2 hours at least to do the car drive if you want to get a real feel for the battlefield. We visited in October and the foliage was spectacular - along with the frequent deer sightings.

As we drove we saw tarantula's crossing the road and deer feeding on the sides. A little higher the scenery started to change with more pine and fur trees. About 3 quarters of the way up you can stop at a scenic point and look up at Moro Rock. This is worth climbing, the view is amazing and it is not too hard of a hike. 400 steps in all. Continuing on as you pass through 5500 feet altitude you can start to spot smaller Giant Sequoia trees. Passing through 6000ft you drive around a bend and there in front of you are those massive trees. We were in awe at the immense size of these ancient trees.

Going down is easy, most of the paths are wide and all of the stairs have hand rails, however, there are some places with drop offs. The day we were there 2 grade 4 classes were visiting. I thought the teachers were brave souls but they had no issues. I am uncomfortable with heights but was able to negotiate the trails with minimal problem and thoroughly enjoyed it. For those who prefer not to hike down into the canyon, there is a paved trail on the rim with 2 railed lookouts to view the caves.Thanks to previous reviews we were prepared with hiking shoes, sun screen, hats and plenty of water. We took our time, did both trails, looked at the storehouse ruins and spent 3 hours. All for $5 per person - admission also covers other Nation Monuments in the vicinity.

Probably there are more used sleds available in the afternoon, but you'll have to fight to crowds. If you want to slide fast, get the wax. Also, if you want to go fast, lean back, almost horizontal, when you slide. Once you are in the park itself, there is lots of space, so it really can't get too crowded. Definitely take a change of shoes and socks, because you can't really get it all out of your shoes right away. Also don't forget sunscreen and sunglasses, even in the winter, the sun is intense.

We enjoyed a short talk by a ranger before driving on to the picnic spots. I would definitely recommend taking a picnic to enjoy at one of the shaded tables provided. (There are also toilets at each picnic area). We found a spot to sledge down the dunes, which everyone enjoyed. Spent about two and a half hours there in total. ",

We arrived earlier than expected on our first day so we decided to catch the sunset and free up our second day for swimming. We started by going to the information center at the park to get their advice on the best way to enjoy the dunes and they suggested we start with a guided sunset ranger tour. We took the guided tour and got some great sunset pictures. The next day all four of our children wanted to return to the park instead of swimming at the hotel (This has never happened before!!??!) so we went back again later in the day when it's not so hot and just let the kids run and play in the sand. On our second visit we did our own thing as we were now more familiar with the park. I took more pictures and we stayed until dark. Because we have younger children we just went to play in the sand and take pictures. We did not take any of the longer hikes so I can't comment on the trails. We didn't have to go far from the parking lots for the kids to play. Definitely bring your camera, water bottle(s) and bare feet. The sand does not get hot. Of all the stops we had on our road trip this was unanimously everyone's favorite. The park passes cost us $6.00 (our kids were all free) and was valid for seven days so we went multiple times and with every visit we went deeper into the park. (The kids asked to go back for a bit on the third day when we were on our way out of town to say \"goodbye\" to the sand). Adults will enjoy the beauty and kids will have a blast rolling and sliding down the dunes.",

I thought this was a good deal, but the slides cost about $20 each and could add up for a big family. Climbing up to the top of these sandhills is quite an exercise in the heat, but then the slide downhill on those plastic things is kind of fun. Good walking shoes are also recommended. We managed the sand barefooted, but some of the flat areas connecting the sand hills are crusted and full of thorny plants. Not for the unseasoned farefood walker. ",

The dune life nature trail and the Alkali Flats trail are a most for adventurers. Be sure to bring plenty of water and sun protection with you as the hike is approximately 6 miles in total but offers spectacular views and experiences of waling in an alien world. I would not recommend this for children. The visitors center does offer snow sled rentals that you can use to go sledding on the sand dunes. Walking though the desert and finishing our trek as the sun set behind the mountains is surely a life event not to be forgotten.

If you are camping and you can get in early, stay at the Red Cliff Campground. $15 instead of $42 at the KOA and its up in the Red Cliffs. Really nice at sunset. If you like the desert, open spaces, gaping chasms and wild rock formations, you will love Zion, Bryce, Monument and of course the Grand Canyon. If you're not camping, park outside the National Park entrance up away from the shops for easy parking for the day (not time limited), it's an easy walk to the park entrance and the free shuttle service that will take you to all stops up to the famous Narrows walk (about 40 minutes away). If the water is running then some of these walks will be spectacular (emerald pools and weeping cliffs), if the water is low definitely consider the Narrows. It's a easy days worth. Really cool rock formations both in and on the way out of Zion. Definitely take the route 9 exit (to Bryce Canyon) if you can, more sensational rock formations, and a couple of really nice camping grounds that aren't well advertised if you want an early start to get to Bryce. Oh and if you are doing a National Park crawl, make sure you get the Annual Pass for $80, it's approx $30 for entry at most National Parks, so it pays off pretty quickly.",

It took about 1 hour to find a parking space and as we decided to go lease we found a PAYABLE parking lot (10 dollars per day), so we decided to give it a try. Once in the park you only understand why you could'nt find a parking space : TOO MUCH VISITORS! Luckily you have to take a shuttle into the park otherwiste it would be impossible to visit the few points of interests.Of all the NP we've did this one was the least interesting exept when you are into hiking (and we're not)!",

We chose to have hot showers and nice warm bed with clean sheets. ",

Hiked the Riverside Walk and the Canyon Overlook Trail -- that was a nice mix, as the Riverside Walk takes you along the river at the bottom of one of the canyons (i.e., mostly flat), and the Canyon Overlook takes you up to the top of some of the cliffs (i.e., fairly steep elevation change). When we got to the end of the dry area on the Riverside Walk, we took off our shoes and socks to cross the river (really cold!) so we could hike a little farther into the Narrows -- we didn't get very far, as pretty soon the river fills the canyon from wall to wall, but we met a few people who had been able to hike much farther up-river because they were wearing special boots (which apparently you can buy/rent in Springdale). Well worth the visit (and the $30 entry fee, good for 7 days).",
